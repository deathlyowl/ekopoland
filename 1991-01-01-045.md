**What does it mean?**

The packaging is made from fabrics other than cotton and jute (TEX) - number 62.

**What to do with**

In case of textile products, their multiple use is recommended, which also applies to packaging made from natural fibres. If, however, the packaging can no longer be used, in order to select the best form for its management it is advisable to contact the nearest point for separate waste collection or organisation responsible for waste management in the area. 

**It is good to know**

The label is of significant importance during the identification of packaging waste and while deciding about its future fate.

**Where to find**

The label can be found on packaging.
