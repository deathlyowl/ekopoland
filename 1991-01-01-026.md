**What does it mean?**

The label informs us that used electrical and electronic equipment ("electro waste") shall not be discarded together with other types of waste to the containers for municipal waste (household dustbins).

**What to do with**

Electro-waste should be disposed to authorised places (so-called points for separate collection of municipal waste), which are organised in different towns/cities or the option of the so-called junk disposal should be used. Used electrical and electronic equipment can be also disposed to the points of sale or service, provided that they collect such equipment.

**It is good to know**

Disposal of waste marked with this label to household waste containers is dangerous for the environment. Such conduct is punishable with a fine up to PLN 5,000.
The label is of significant importance during the identification of packaging waste and while deciding about its future fate.

**Where to find**

This label is placed directly on electrical and electronic equipment and in its documentation (e.g. user's manual), it can be put on packaging of these types of products and on resulting waste (electro-waste).
