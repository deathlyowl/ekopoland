**What does it mean?**

The packaging is made from a composite consisting of plastic and aluminium - number 90. 

**What to do with**

In order to select the best method for the management of packaging waste with this label, the best solution is to contact an organisation responsible for municipal waste management in the area and follow its guidelines.

**It is good to know**

There may be the abbreviation "C/**" under the label, which specifies the materials forming the composite, and "**" means the dominant material. The label is of significant importance during the identification of packaging waste and while deciding about its future fate.

**Where to find**

The label can be found on packaging.
