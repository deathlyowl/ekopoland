**What does it mean?**

The label informs us that the battery (cell) is made up of a carbon-zinc system (CZ) - number 14.

**Benefits**

Sorting of waste batteries and accumulators saves the environment also because through recycling it is possible to recover metals which may be valuable secondary raw materials for the manufacture of new products. It is important as metals are manufactured from ores which are non-renewable mineral resources.

**What to do with**

Due to the presence of metals, used batteries and accumulators are hazardous waste and need to be segregated. They shall not be placed in containers with other types of waste. They shall be discarded to special containers for used batteries or delivered to the points for separate collection of municipal waste organised in different towns/cities.

**It is good to know**

The label is of significant importance during the identification of packaging waste and while deciding about its future fate.

**Where to find**

This label is placed on batteries (cells), which are often essential accessories for many types of electrical and electronic equipment. Therefore, it can also be found on used batteries or in the used electrical equipment.
