**What does it mean?**

It indicates that the packaging is reusable.

**Benefits**

It is worth considering the re-use of such packaging and not throwing it away after a single use - it may fulfil its function repeatedly.

**It is good to know**

Extending the life of products is environmentally friendly - it prevents the production of new packaging and excessive exploitation of natural resources.

**Where to find**

The label is placed on packaging and is of significant importance during the identification of the resulting packaging waste and while deciding about its future fate.
