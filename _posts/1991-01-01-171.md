**What does it mean?**

This label informs us that the packaging is made from a polymer called high-density polyethylene (RHDPE, RHD-PE, RPE-HD) - number 2 or 02 from recycling (so-called recyclate).

**Benefits**

The packaging is made from a secondary raw material, thus avoiding the need to use the primary environmental resources.

**What to do with**

After use, packaging with this label should be disposed to waste containers marked with the sign PLASTICS.

**It is good to know**

The label is of significant importance during the identification of packaging waste and while deciding about its future fate.

**Where to find**

The label can be found on packaging.
