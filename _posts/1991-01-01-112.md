**What does it mean?**

The UN label has been introduced by the United Nations (Committee of Experts of the European Economic Commission) for the transport of dangerous goods, pursuant to the European Agreement concerning the International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road (ADR). Packaged goods are classified to one of 13 classes of risks and are granted a four-digit UN number, which is placed at the label. This number corresponds to the dangerous properties of goods and based on that a relevant method of transport is selected, as well as proper packaging and procedures to ensure safety in normal conditions of road transport.

**Benefits**

The label guarantees that the packaging is adapted to the hazardous properties of packed goods and it ensures their safe protection.

**Where to find**

The label can be found on packaging of dangerous goods.
