**What does it mean?**

The label has been in force since 1 July 2010 as the official label of the European Union, which is awarded to products of agricultural origin complying with the EU legislation in organic farming.

**Benefits**

The label certifies that:
- the product bearing it meets the requirements of official supervision
- the product comes from certified organic farms
- at least 95% of product ingredients have been made by organic methods, i.e. in an environmentally friendly manner, without the use of mineral fertilizers, while preserving biodiversity and ensuring the well-being of animals.

**Where to find**

The EU marking can be found on food products. It can be also found on waste generated after the use of such products.
