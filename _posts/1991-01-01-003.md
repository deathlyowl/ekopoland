**What does it mean?**

This label specifies the suitability of the product or its packaging for recycling. A product or packaging with this label can be recycled into a new product of full value.

**Benefits**

Recycling contributes to the reduction in the waste volume, and to saving of natural resources.

**What to do with**

It is important that such product or packaging should be segregated after use and put into a suitable waste container. Mobius Loop may apply only to products or to their packaging.

**It is good to know**

If there is a number inside the label or under it, it informs that the product or packaging already contains secondary material that had been recycled. Thus, there was no need to use original natural raw materials and the volume of waste has been reduced. The number placed at the label specifies the percentage content of secondary raw material in the final material.

**Where to find**

The label can be found on various product categories, including packaging made from recyclable materials.
