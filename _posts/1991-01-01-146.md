**What does it mean?**

The label guarantees biodegradability of the product or its packaging in the household compost.

**It is good to know**

The term "biodegradable" is often used, however biodegradability depends significantly on the environment. Something that will decompose in an industrial composting plant will not always decompose under household conditions. The label is of significant importance during the identification of packaging waste and while deciding about its future fate.

**Certificate**

The mark is the confirmation of the certificate of the AIB-Vin√ßotte Group.

**Where to find**

The label can be found on packaging.
