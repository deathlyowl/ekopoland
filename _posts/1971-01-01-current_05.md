body: Replace regular light bulbs with energy-saving ones. They consume less energy and have longer life span. Remember that you cannot dispose of such a bulb in the trash after use because it contains about 5 mg of mercury. It has to be delivered to one of the points from where it will be directed for further processing (point of selective collection of municipal waste, the so called gratowisko).
