body: Some products, such as refrigerators and other electrical equipment, must be disposed of in a special way, only this way they won't pollute the environment. Contact a specialised company engaged in the disposal of electronic waste in your area. If the items still have some value, sell them over the Internet or donate them to others who may find them useful.
