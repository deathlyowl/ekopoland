**What does it mean?**

This label informs on the durability of cosmetic products. Inside the mark there is a number of months (M) or years (Y) given, during which the cosmetic is suitable for use, starting from its first opening. For example, 3M means that the cosmetic is suitable for use within the period of 3 months after first opening.

**Benefits**

The label allows for the rational use of cosmetics and helps to avoid the risk that they have expired, and thus prevents the generation of unnecessary waste. Additionally, it reduces the risk of health problems due to the application of a cosmetic no longer suitable for use.

**Where to find**

This label can be found on cosmetics, but also on waste generated after the use of such products.
