body: Mulch around plants is very beneficial. It helps maintain the proper temperature of the soil, prevents the spread of weeds and reduces evaporation. Remember though, that it shouldn't be placed too close to stems or trunks - in winter the plants might begin to rot. Use pebbles, bark, pine cones, cut grass, compost from leaves or bruised ceramics.
