**What does it mean?**

The product meets the requirements of the European COSMOS standard for organic (ecological) cosmetics, developed by five organisations awarding environmental labels to cosmetics: BDIH from Germany, Cosmebio and Ecocert from France, ICEA from Italy and Soil Association from the UK.

**Benefits**

In this product at least 95% of ingredients of agricultural origin subject to physical treatment (and at least 20% of all ingredients) have been manufactured in accordance with the principles of organic farming, which means that for their manufacture no mineral fertilizers or pesticides have been used and attention has been paid to soil fertility and well-being of animals. Moreover, the packaging has been designed with care for the environment.

**Where to find**

The label can be found on cosmetics and packaging waste generated after the use of such products.
