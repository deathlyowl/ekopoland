**What does it mean?**

The label is to confirm that the organisation (e.g. a manufacturer) has successfully completed the certification process conducted by the entity CARBON NEUTRAL.

**Benefits**

The presence of the label proves that the organisation meets the standards stipulated in The CarbonNeutral Protocol and it has taken the initiative to mitigate its carbon footprint. This also means that the organisation has reduced its emissions of greenhouse gases into the environment and taken compensatory measures resulting in the fact that the carbon footprint of its operations is neutral (zero).

**It is good to know**

This label is the guarantee of actions taken within an organisation for the benefit of environment, in particular in order to prevent global warming.

**Where to find**

The label is awarded to organisations for their activities aimed at neutralisation of the carbon footprint. In practice, it may be awarded to an organisation manufacturing any products or providing any services.
