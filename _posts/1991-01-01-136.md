**What does it mean?**

The label shows the energy efficiency of equipment by means of colours and the corresponding letter scale (A-G). The least economical equipment is classified as class G, marked with a red stripe, while the most efficient one as class A, with a green stripe. Apart from the energy consumption, the scale may demonstrate other parameters relevant to the product, e.g. CO2 consumption or fuel efficiency. The A-G scale can be extended by three additional classes: A+, A++ and A+++, for the most effective products.

**Benefits**

Due to the scale introduced, you can easily estimate the energy efficiency of the product.

**Where to find**

The label is awarded to electrical and electronic equipment.
