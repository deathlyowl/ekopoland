**What does it mean?**

Organic Cosmetics label is awarded by the organisation NATRUE to organic cosmetics.

**Benefits**

Label guarantees that the product meets the requirements of the organisation NATRUE for natural cosmetics. In addition, this label ensures that at least 95% of the natural product ingredients come from controlled organic farming or controlled, so-called wild crops. Currently, very few cosmetics are able to meet these stringent requirements, which constitute a real challenge for manufacturers.


**Where to find**

The label can be found on cosmetics and waste generated after the use of such products.
