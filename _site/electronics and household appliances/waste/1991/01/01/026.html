<p><strong>What does it mean?</strong></p>

<p>The label informs us that used electrical and electronic equipment (&quot;electro waste&quot;) shall not be discarded together with other types of waste to the containers for municipal waste (household dustbins).</p>

<p><strong>What to do with</strong></p>

<p>Electro-waste should be disposed to authorised places (so-called points for separate collection of municipal waste), which are organised in different towns/cities or the option of the so-called junk disposal should be used. Used electrical and electronic equipment can be also disposed to the points of sale or service, provided that they collect such equipment.</p>

<p><strong>It is good to know</strong></p>

<p>Disposal of waste marked with this label to household waste containers is dangerous for the environment. Such conduct is punishable with a fine up to PLN 5,000.
The label is of significant importance during the identification of packaging waste and while deciding about its future fate.</p>

<p><strong>Where to find</strong></p>

<p>This label is placed directly on electrical and electronic equipment and in its documentation (e.g. user&#39;s manual), it can be put on packaging of these types of products and on resulting waste (electro-waste).</p>
