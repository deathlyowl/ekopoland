<p><strong>What does it mean?</strong></p>

<p>The label shows the energy efficiency of equipment by means of colours and the corresponding letter scale (A-G). The least economical equipment is classified as class G, marked with a red stripe, while the most efficient one as class A, with a green stripe. Apart from the energy consumption, the scale may demonstrate other parameters relevant to the product, e.g. CO2 consumption or fuel efficiency. The A-G scale can be extended by three additional classes: A+, A++ and A+++, for the most effective products.</p>
