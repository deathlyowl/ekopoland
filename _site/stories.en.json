			"title":"Saying goodbye to Nokia",
			"body":"<p>The door bell rang and she knew that it was too late. The plane left without her. The alarm clock in the new phone instead of a ringtone with the power of Rammstein apparently tried to wake her up with something similar to melody good for a cat. No, rather not. Think again. Tiger was also asleep, which she guessed by feeling something warm and fluffy close to her right foot. Did she really need to buy that new phone?! Did I, seriously?! Yes, he cleverly it to sold her. The guy in the shop rather than put any effort with who knows what, simply took her picture. One photo was enough to ignite the wild desire to have a phone immediately producing such miracles. Stupid Instagram, stupid filters and stupid salesman. And she was the stupidest in this all. That it looked like something from a kid’s program? That there wasn’t even one wrinkle? So what?! The times of Anne of Green Gables should always remain there where it belongs - on the junk pile, together with old VCRs and walkmans. And now everything is lost. There won’t be the hot beach, no drinks with an umbrella and also no handsome Greek.<br />Who’s banging at the door? Indeed, one can’t even feel sorry about one’s fate in peace and quiet. Where’s the fire? One would be able to smell the smoke, but here in the air was only bitterness and disappointment. Probably the neighbour again from flat number four forgot to turn off the water and now it is pouring on the tiles in her bathroom and the new washing machine that she especially bought for the cat. “You’ll get rid of all that cat hair and you’ll never find even a single hair on your clothes!”. What a joke. Yesterday none of her black T-shirts were fit to show people, not to mention co-workers. If she had known that it will be like this, she would have never dreamed about the nightmare of carrying the old washing machine down from the fourth floor and replacing it with a new one, carrying it supposedly along the same route, but feeling like it was twice as long. Do washing machines really have to weigh so much? Can’t they make them from some cosmic materials from NASA, like they show on Discovery? Anyway, the old washing machine was better. A person knew what to expect and didn’t have unnecessary illusions. In addition, somehow it used less electricity. Maybe from this A++ on the door?<br />In her thoughts she counted all the equipment which recently cluttered her microscopic flat. Toaster - one. Microwave - two. TV, washing machine, dish washer - another three. God, it would be enough not just for Chalkidiki but for Hollywood! A person would walk around like Marilyn under palm trees and grin with an American smile. But instead one’s left in Warsaw with a loan to pay off and a flooded bathroom. Now all that is left is to reheat toast in the microwave and stare at the beach on the TV.<br />Stupid, stupid, stupid! After all, the old equipment wasn’t so old and secondly they worked like they should. Well, almost, but it was no great tragedy. And now they are rusting somewhere and emitting asbestos or other harmful garbage. What is causing her eyes to suddenly sting? No, maybe something is on fire. Go Tiger and check, ok? Mommy still wants to weep for a moment over the injustice and callousness of the world.<br />For example, the old phone. It rang, loud enough to wake the dead! That it was a little scratched? So what. If every scratched thing was discriminated against, she wouldn’t have enough for makeup and cotton swabs. Therefore this Greece appeared, for supposedly nothing is seen under a tan. Probably another lie. But it was nice to believe. Cursed Anne of Green Gables syndrome! Get a hold of yourself girl, some things even plaster can’t fix. It’s time to face the morning view in the mirror and not buy any more embroidered cushions, because the design on the cheek doesn’t fade that quickly.<br />By the way, why do only girls have a problem with that? A guy wouldn’t even think of putting cream on his face. Oh, well. If he is under fifty and wears a cap, he can still use his school ID on the bus. And what about her? Like the old phone - scratch on scratch, as if someone drew on glass with a rock.<br />Enough of this! From today, no new junk, no Instagrams and other mixers. We’re going back to basics and shifting into manual mode, Tiger, and that’s all there is to it. The new me and the new cat, but equipment only old and proven. No smartphone will spit in our face and ruin a hard-earned holiday! There will be no more unnecessarily discarded phones contributing to the destruction of the planet! It will be conscious and environmental. To get off to a good start we’ll replace the doorbell. We mount a knocker or something. Enough of terror and poisonous impulses in one’s own home!<br />Whew, her humour at once improved and everything seemed to turn green all around.<br />You know what Tiger, I think probably Anna is ringing the doorbell. She was to take you for two weeks, while I was to be frying like bacon on the beach. So I guess I’ll get up and open the door, huh? What do you think, can I still rebook the plane ticket? That new phone has, I think, such a function.</p><br />"

			"title":"A dog’s day",
			"body":"<p>My parents left me the dog. They left on holiday to warm countries, and me - a representative of corporate slaves with holidays “as soon as there will be a little slack” they sponsored ten days alone with a monster. Supposedly nothing - just a little poodle, in fact a miniature. Only that my previous contact with this poodle was limited to several long weekends and holidays. The dog, probably not accustomed to me, fell into depression and I couldn’t convince her to eat any food left by her holidaying master. Neither groats from neighbouring Lubelski fields, nor ecologically raised chicken, nor even carrots, which were grown without any pesticides. If it continues going like this, I shall have on my conscience both the animal and my mother when she returns.<br />Explaining it all to the dog didn’t help. The dog, actually a bitch with the beautiful name of Daisy, only looked at me like I was crazy. It is likely, moreover, that she may have a point. Kneeling on the floor next to the bowl, with a pleading look on my face, I was reminded of that crazy crone who in the fairy tales fattened children with sweets. I didn’t suspect that the dog was familiar with it and was afraid that she will finish like they did, in the oven (but of course there was a happy end), but you never know. Daisy is smart beast and maybe she heard this somewhere.<br />Returning though to the problem. The day passed and not one morsel disappeared from the bowl. The dog probably didn’t lose any weight on this account, but under that fur it is difficult to guess. Maybe I should get the advice of an expert? I turned on the comp and voilà! Good uncle Google states that when a dog gets hungry, it will start to eat. Apparently he hasn’t heard yet about Daisy. What will happen if she doesn’t start? If she has anorexia or, God forbid, twisted bowels because of this hunger? “You know, Mum, Daisy didn’t make it till your return, but don’t worry, I’ll buy you a new dog”. Seriously, uncle good advice? You try telling her that!<br />Never mind. Apparently she does not like the taste of chicken with carrots. So what that this is ecological, from local production and without preservatives. How do poodles know that such food is, in the first place, healthier, and secondly, don’t ruin the planet. Thinking about the secrets of dog breeding, I go to the pet shop for food. I come back, pour in the bowl and wait. The dog comes, sniffs and grimaces so cruelly, that if I did not see it myself, I wouldn’t believe it. Daisy, I beg you a hundredfold, please don’t do this. See what good dog food there is, colourful and smells good. Do you know how many dogs suffer from famine in Africa? How many don’t even have a bowl to lick? Eat at least a little.<br />The dog sticks out her tongue as a demonstration and leaves, while I begin to read the label. Look: cereals, meat, animal products, fats, vegetables. What’s the matter? Sounds like recipe for dinner that I could eat myself. I read on: mineral substances, protein and calcium. Well, animals also need vitamins. After all, this glossy fur doesn’t come from tap water. Copper sulphate, manganese sulphate, zinc sulphate... oh my gosh! That was close. I almost stuffed an innocent dog with the entire Mendeleev’s table! I’m sorry, Daisy. I had no idea what was in this dog food. Well, it’s good that you did not eat it, because you could even begin to shine. In the end, we are what we eat, right?<br />I placed the bowl full of toxic fumes near the rubbish bin. Mum taught that even such food cannot be thrown away, so at least let the neighbourhood cats think it over. If they have any instinct of self-preservation, they’ll avoid it like the plague and there won’t be any casualties.<br />With wisdom gained from a chemistry set as a kid, I decided to act in accordance with my own eating patterns. I also don’t like groats, so why should I be surprised at the dog? Therefore today, Daisy, I am making dinner. The first course: ecological lentils with curry. On the table straight from a farmer I know, who has all the certificates. The curry is not from the farmer, but it was also grown without degradation to the environment. Next: fresh fish in butter with thyme. Don’t worry, Daisy. This time I’ll read all the labels before I buy. They wrote with the smallest fonts, but I squinted and somehow struggled through it so there wouldn’t be another disaster. I had enough strength left to choose ice cream for dessert. Sounds tasty? Ok Daisy, let’s get to work.<br />After two hours the kitchen looked like a battlefield, and me, Frankenstein’s sister with the announced meal - closer to an unidentified substance. However, Daisy didn’t look like anything, because simply she was not there. Nowhere. My desperate cries, pleas and requests were for nothing. The dog disappeared. Evaporated into thin air. Looking around I remembered what works for this nasty poodle. The lead! It was enough to take it off the hook, and the dog stood at the door like a sprinter ready to run. That’s right, but apparently the lead grew legs. Is today really a day of disappearing dogs and their accessories? Where could I have put it?<br />Take it easy. Calm down girl and remind yourself, step by step, what you did. Ok, I returned from the shop, opened the door and carried the groceries to the kitchen. Daisy did not get under my feet and, therefore, she didn’t return with me. And since she didn’t return, she is still there, that poor thing, tied up next to the shop.<br />After ten minutes of murderous physical effort, apologizing to the dog in all ways possible and tears shed over my own recklessness we both returned to the house. Immediately after entering Daisy ran to the bowl and engulfed her chicken with groats. Then with style the miniature poodle went to the bedroom, leaving me in complete shock. Was uncle Google right or did my cooking scare her?</p><br />"

			"title":"Moth’s mourning memory in b flat",
			"body":"<p>Inside the wardrobe there was unusual excitement as for this time of year. Instead of summer stagnation, for all the furs were protected in plastic covers with mothballs, there was the best July night fever between the clothes hangers.<br />“Maurice, Maurice!” An excited voice echoed in the darkness. “Look at the cotton she bought! A beauty! Straight from a plantation in Alabama, naturally grown and unsprayed.<br />Maurice Moth flew closer and carefully observed the label on the green dress. (It’s a myth that moths are blind as moles. They see as good as bats in the dark. Or maybe owls?). Luckily, Maurice was able to decipher and even spell:<br />“One hundred per cent organic cotton. Made in the USA.”<br />“Ho, ho, high fashion! By the looks Calvin Klein, by the smell second-hand.”<br />Both of these names were the sweetest music to his ears. (One should know that Maurice has an aristocratic background and he had a fussy and delicate taste).<br />“Gustav, we have a unique opportunity to experience art in its pure form!”<br />Gustav was perhaps not so experienced as his friend was, but he recognised a good thing spot on. However, in order not to give the impression of being a thick-skinned glutton, he began modestly, from the collar.<br />“Mmm, delicious. Handmade, no industrial Chinese product.”<br />Suddenly a piece of the collar got stuck in his throat at Maurice’s disgusted look.<br />“W-h-a-t?”<br />“Gustav, eating such a beautiful dress is a manifestation of barbarism for the world of people and insects! Look here: the label has a symbol of a sphere with a kind of eye in the middle, under which it reads that this is a fair trade product. Do you know what that means? Of course, you don’t. It means nothing more or less than thanks to this cotton that you are now chewing, our brothers in the Third World may enjoy the taste of school uniforms! That’s right, Gustav. Indeed, it means that products with this symbol have been produced without using child labour, without exploiting fairly paid workers and with respect for the natural environment. Money from the sale of this cotton went to social initiatives, such as the said school.”<br />Gustav was so overwhelmed that a flake of cotton fell out of his mouth, even though he is not so sensitive.<br />“That’s not all that you don’t know about this beautiful dress, Gustav. I guess you have already sensed its delicate scent, similar to the smell of a cat and old vase water. Well, first of all this smell indicates that the dress is vintage and thus environmentally friendly and economical. Second of all: it has been rarely washed, so no detergent is wasted to destroy all of us. Dirt, dear Gustav, has a great future! Each washing decreases the quality of clothes and increases its susceptibility to further contamination. In addition, washing machines used by humans are real beasts, devouring electricity and water to the detriment of our insect world! Will you deny it, Gustav?”<br />Gustav did not want to deny, because the vision of an electricity devouring beast paralysed not only his tongue.<br />“So, let’s move on.” Maurice took a breath of fresh air and continued with a bass voice: “This green colour was not created in the laboratory of a chemist, but on the palette of an artist like Leonardo. Of course, dear Gustav, you have no idea who Leonardo was. I assure you, though, that what you are trying to feast on, not only looks like grass, but it also tastes like grass. There are no pesticides or other disgusting things, only ecological colouring in harmony with nature.<br />Not knowing why, somehow for Gustav the word “nature” resulted in a strong desire for immediate evacuation - leaving the dress, the wardrobe and the entire lecture. He had just lifted his wings to fly, when Maurice suddenly said something that stunned him for good.<br />“But the most important reason why we cannot even lick this dress is our conscience. No need to blush Gustav. I’ve discovered a long time ago, that in fact you are a decent insect, Gustav. Now conscience - Yes! Conscience! We would choke if we destroyed such a beautiful thing by simple gluttony. Old and molted furs - you can. Patched woollen sweaters and gloves - no problem. Worn-out coats and hats - bon appetite, my friend. We wouldn’t harm anyone, because sooner or later they would end up in a container for worn-out clothing. However, investing in a famous designer - that’s a completely different story.<br />Frankly, Gustav was already tired of everything. He was tired of the designers, organic cotton plantations, and even this dress. But since his conscience was exposed, he had to play his role to the end.<br />“So, this means that we are not eating, right? Perhaps just the sleeves, long sleeves aren’t needed in such heat ...”<br />“Where is your honour, Gustav?!” Maurice roared with rage like a fire siren. “Aren’t you getting anything in your insect brain?”<br />“I am, but slowly, because I’m hungry. I can’t feed on honour, can I?”<br />“You’re wrong again, Gustav. Well, will be having honour for dinner today - Japanese style. I prefer this than let you commit the crime of eating it!”<br />“So, are we are going to eat flip-flops?” Gustav asked confused.<br />“Something much better. Have you ever heard of Harakiri? Come on, let’s fly to that shirt. We’ll have polyester for the last supper.”</p><br />"

			"title":"Amber, an ordinary bottle",
			"body":"<p>Amber was an ordinary bottle. She was a PET bottle no one usually pays attention to, unless someone wished to drink its content. Traditional polymer bottles, just like Amber, are not biodegradable, which in theory should make her happy. However, Amber was not happy. She felt that there was something wrong with her, something was completely wrong when she was produced. Should it really happen that normal bottles, such as Amber, enjoy almost divine, eternal life? You could bury a bottle in the ground, trodden the soil and after three hundred years dig it up and probably it would still be suitable for use. Is it not a frightening perspective? At any time someone could bury her somewhere and then she would spend all eternity, thinking whether she would ever encounter anything nice. Or would she lie there, buried deep down in the ground, like a pirates’ chest, waiting to be discovered? Waiting for who knows how long until someone finally recycles her. If she really was a pirates’ chest, she would surely increase her chance to be returned to use. But she was just an ordinary plastic bottle which can be found everywhere.<br />This did not seem right to Amber. She often chatted about it with her friend from the shelf, Damian. Damian was not like the other bottles, even though he looked the same. He liked listening to Amber, and in the evenings, when the light was fading in the store, Damian would rub his label against Amber’s bottle cap. It was really nice, Amber thought, though she was ashamed that Damian could not imagine the world outside the warehouse. And yet, Amber believed that the real adventure was out there. They were still young, but the crowd of bottles standing next to them had no understanding for this kind of ambition and perhaps that was the reason why Damian resisted such thoughts. He said that anything that is important is in the warehouse. Besides, there are only other warehouses outside, so what is the point of moving from where they are warm and dry. And then Damian told a story of a bottle, which rolled outside and she was brought back after a few days, all trembling, dirty and with a scratched bottom. She couldn’t say what happened to her. She was only good for the trash bin now.<br />Despite the resistance of some of the bottles, the fact was that the Big Exit did happen from time to time. None of the bottles knew where their friends were really being taken. Stories about a new, wonderful life, full of luxurious refrigerators between palm trees mixed with dark stories about the Final Bottle Solution. The truth, however, remained unknown. No bottle has ever returned to the warehouse to tell the others what awaits them. It was, of course, grist to the mill for pessimists but it did not depress the optimists. “Why would they come back if the outside was so wonderful?” they argued in response.<br />When the time came for the forklift to take the pallet where Amber, Damian and the others lived, Amber welcomed the moment with excitement, but also fear. Finally, they’ll know what’s on the other side. They were loaded on a trailer without windows and so their first journey began. Amber was never good at geography (why would she be, apparently no one cared about the education of plastic bottles), but Amber could bet that they travelled hundreds, if not hundreds of thousands of kilometres. This gave her courage. If they were really so unimportant, as some older bottles argued, would someone take them on such a long journey? If they were to be disposed of, it could be done just around the corner. If someone was taking them so far away, apparently their lives had some deeper meaning.<br />In the shop, where the bottles were placed, everything was wonderfully different. Amber knew that there are other products in the world aside from bottles. But she never imagined that there were so many! Looking at them from the third shelf in the “Beverages” section Amber was wondering what type of life they might have, what they desire, what happens to them? She couldn’t wait for all these conversations and new experiences, but before Amber dared to start a conversation with anyone, someone’s hand grabbed her and threw her into the cart between other products. No one knew where they were being taken. Besides, there was no special time for speculations, because after a while she again found herself in the back of a car. It was dark and cold, and Damian was left alone on the shelf. Amber did not even have time to say goodbye to him, she did not even have time to think about it. Everything happened so fast. Amber began talking with other products. It turned out that the world is full of warehouses similar to the one in which Amber lived. In fact, the products were not aware that there was another world behind the warehouse doors. Well, of course, there was the shop to which they were all destined. But not much more. “Warehouses, shops and travelling back and forth” Amber thought. It had little to do with the adventures that Amber had imagined.<br />Suddenly, someone started rummaging in the bag where Amber was, grabbed her really firm, and opened the bottle. He pressed his lips to her neck, but Amber immediately realised that it was not true love. After a few seconds, she was empty inside. Amber felt so useless and unnecessary as never before.<br />Apparently, Amber was not the only one to feel this way, but also the man who drank so fast. As soon as he finished he screwed the cap back on (as if he didn’t know that crushing a bottle with its cap on requires much more energy) and tossed her out the window. The edge of the road, where she landed, was an interesting variation. But it’s hard to say that it was a positive one. Since the road was deserted, Amber was not much resistant to wind, which easily carried her deeper and deeper in the desert. She was getting dirtier and more battered, and the sun was beating down mercilessly. Each new gust of wind moved Amber further away from civilization and significantly reduced the chance that she will be recycled and start a new, interesting life. When she finally stopped on a pile of rubbish by a fence, she realised that nothing more awaits her. Dirty, tired and useless products did not want to communicate with Amber. Amber was not sure whether they were no longer able to do so or just simply didn’t like strangers. Amber buried herself in the sand, dreaming of a final utilisation, which she will probably never experience.</p><br />"

			"body":"<p>Every cloud has a silver lining Martha thought and wiped the tears from her wet check with the sleeve of the jackets. She was still a little sad, but was slowly calming down. Her hands were still shaking a little, and her eyelids for certain were still swollen, but the feeling of rejection that was pulsating somewhere in the middle of her chest slowly probably had to escape somewhere. Perhaps, she thought, sadness leaves the body with the tears, because the longer she cried, the more it left. She could even stop imagining herself as a haven of peace, a damn laid-back lotus flower on a crystal clear lake. Anyways, it didn’t work out that great. She rather felt like a dead fish laying on the surface of a pool of crude oil. Sticky darkness was all about, the end of which was not in sight. But somewhere a light started to shine. But the question was, is this the light of a lifeboat or rather still only the lights of a sinking tanker?<br />When Martha lost work two months ago in one of the trendy clothing boutiques, located in a big shopping centre on the outskirts of Warsaw, she was convinced that finding new employment would be a matter of days, possibly weeks. The following days and weeks, however, started to brutally verify her view. Although sending her CV went quite well, receiving responses went much worse. Of course, she had no illusions that every potential employer would respond to her. However, the daily check of the inbox, which each time seemed to be more and more empty, turned out to be quite a frustrating task. When at last she was invited for an interview, she was confident that now all will go downhill. After all, how much can one climb? Even the longest climb must come to an end. Even more so that the boutique which responded seemed a great place to work. It advertised as environmentally friendly and selling only ecological products. Martha always worried about the fate of the planet, so she was glad that she could combine business with pleasure. Making money to rescue the planet? Could there be anything better? Well, she imagined, it would be better to save planet without having to earn money. Unfortunately, she had no idea how to rule out this necessity. While at the same time she vaguely sensed that there is a lot of money (too much) in the world, so some of it could at once be transferred to her account , instead of pointlessly travelling the world, from one tax haven to another.<br />The trip to the interview seemed to be much more pleasant than a trip to the post office. The later she knew all too well. However, when she reached the specified address she began to doubt. The shop looked nice. In front of the shop window bloomed aromatic herbs, which was an attractive change for the sterile plant varieties living in air-conditioned shopping centres that had accompanied her so far on her career path. However, she became concerned about the sign placed in one of the shop’s windows: “Cosmetics made from one hundred per cent natural, ecologic materials”. One hundred per cent natural raw material may be peat or other mud, but these are rather not sold in boutiques. Anyways, is today’s mud still one hundred per cent natural? Some acid rain falls a few times and it might turn out that there are more chemicals than in Zyklon B. And, even if such peat did not have any chemical contaminants, there would still be another problem. The packaging would also have to be one hundred per cent natural. That rarely happens. Or maybe these cosmetics would be sold directly into the customer’s hands? Well, possibly a customer could come with her own bucket made from recycling and pick it up that way. However, there is not going to be a queue of women with buckets in front of the shop. On the contrary. The customers visiting the shop rather looked like representatives of the upper middle class. Besides, how should they look like? After all, this was not an open air market in Ciechanów, but an eco boutique in the Żoliborz district. And also one hundred per cent natural? Even the most stringent eco certificates don’t guarantee one hundred per cent. For example, to get such a Cosmebio Eco, ninety-five per cent of raw materials of plant origin used must come from certified ecologic crops. Martha felt that something was not right here, but she went inside.<br />“Do you know what the Blue Angel symbol stands for?” fell the first question, when after a moment of waiting the shop manager invited her to the back room which looked more like a VIP room than a shop storage room.<br />“Of course.” Martha was glad that she knew the correct answer. “It’s the oldest environmental certificate in the world...”<br />“You are oriented, that’s nice...” said the woman interviewing in a tailor-made jacket and a string of pearls who then seemed to hesitate “but you probably never heard of the Green Angel?”<br />“No.”<br />“Exactly. Because here we have such special certificates. More exclusive.”<br />“Oh” Martha only said. “And what is this certification characterized by?”<br />“It’s the best of them all. The Green Angel means that our products are one hundred per cent ecological and biodegradable.”<br />Marta looked around at the cosmetics standing on the shelves. Their plastic packaging looked just as biodegradable as Soviet tanks. She couldn’t understand how the boutique’s owner could practice such shameless greenwashing. She already knew that not only will she not get this job, but that doesn’t want it.<br />“I understand that you need to give the clients crap, but I don’t understand why you feel compelled to deceive prospective employees?”<br />The interviewing woman snorted, then started coughing nervously. Finally, she only managed to get out:<br />“Yesss, thank you, that is probably all.” and with her gaze showed her the door.<br />Martha for a moment glared at the owner, and then quietly got up and left. She felt strangely happy. Well, she didn’t get a job, but at least she knew that she had behaved properly. It was an extremely pleasant feeling. It was as if she helped fifty old people cross a busy street simultaneously. She no longer wanted to cry. She knew that she is strong and can cope. Everything else will be fine, she thought and started walking, feeling that whatever path she selects it will be good.</p><br />"

			"body":"<p>The farther into the forest, the more the trees - the farther from high school, the less space in the cosmetics bag. With such a philosophical view Julia began her day, looking at the arsenal accumulated in the bathroom. The times when soap and water were enough passed more or less half way through elementary school. A wave of transformation swept the nation, and with her - a wave of pimples. It’s good that no one even dreamed yet about the Internet and cameras in a phone, for at least there is no incriminating evidence. The one advantage of all of this growing up was that it passed as quickly as the fashion for jackets made from crash textile. One needs to confess though, that the following fifteen years flew by quickly. And now Julia is who she is and looks as you can see.<br />Supposedly there is no reason to complain, but a sharp eye - especially Julia’s eye - immediately caught symptoms of disintegration and destruction: a battle was waged on her face day after day, which Julia had to win. The massive wrinkle attacks, treacherous landings of discolorations and blasts of bursting vessels required a continuous arms race.<br />That’s why Julia started each day with an inspection of her ammunition and a counter strategy. On the front lines were sent specialised deep penetration materials - the enemy needed to be awaken and immediately neutralized. Reaching for micellar liquid, Julia in her thoughts counted all her allies listed on the packaging: each ecological certificate was worth as much as the best marine unit. It’s true that checking them required some effort, but it was worth it. Julia had enough of those pretending to be natural, with their alleged “bio” which brought more harm than good. Oh no - do your eco brain washing on another battlefield.<br />After a quick review of the troops Julia reached for the heaviest artillery. Sitting until late last night in the club unfortunately left its traces and now mother nature needs to be called to the rescue. Cream from ecologically grown crops, tonic with natural minerals and soap without parabens - Julia felt as if Captain Planet himself came to the rescue. For a moment she imagined herself as she fights an entire army of bacteria and other filth, while landfills of residual dirt disappear forever in the washbasin.<br />Now a critical look in the mirror - somewhat better, but she still can’t lay down her weapons.  Fortunately, there was still an hour before having to leave for work, many such a war could be won in such time. Applying the foundation, Julia thought about all those who do not share her love for morning clashes and slept carefree, while she fought so fiercely. Her younger colleague for example - recently admitted she just needs a morning shower and at the most mascara. Julia was overcome with horror, as if she saw a ghost or other alien.<br />“What do you mean? What about wrinkles? Isn’t old age approaching in the steps of a sprinter? Girl, in a few years do you really want look like your own grandmother in pictures? Of course technology has advanced and there are various filters or other instagrams, but you can’t deceive yourself. The more that young skin soaks in, the more one saves with plastic surgery.<br />From the good of her heart, Julia brought her friend samples from her own stock pile, but neither threats nor requests achieved anything. Yes, her friend was interested in the shampoo with the bunny symbol, but for a short time and only because she loves animals. For sure, she loves! But her shower gel was tested on half of the African jungle. Don’t those people really think about their future? You are what you eat and what you smear on yourself (another proverb from the series she wrote - good, isn’t it?). After all, these packages of pseudo cosmetics in the shops, in packs of four rather than in one large container and imported from God knows what part of Asia, is one large biological bomb! Radiation, chemistry and conflagration for the environment. And then later people are surprised by falling acid rains and tsunamis that come up on the Baltic. Strike the planet and the rubbish will reply, that’s the truth.<br />Well, Julia won’t force them to be happy. She’ll mind her own business and in a few years they’ll see who was right. Under the condition that they’ll recognize her under tonnes of botoks.<br />Daydreaming about catastrophic visions, Julia forgot for a moment about the ongoing war. Suddenly, however, like the firing of a cannon at Samosierra, the alarm clock reminded her about leaving for work.<br />“Oh no, here I am thinking about acid rains, and in twenty minutes I have my first meeting!” Quickly, the last manoeuvre and time to inspect the fortifications. Powder - present. Lipstick - present. Painted eyelashes - present. Lip liner, blush, concealer and eye liner - at their positions. No signs of old age will get past.<br />Leaving the bathroom, Julia glanced once more for a quick check. Whew. Not so bad for someone who will turn thirty next year. Captain Planet for certain wouldn’t be able to resist her.</p><br />"

			"body":"<p>Nothing in him could make her more upset than not segregating rubbish. Of course he probably had some other flaws. Although none of them came to her mind right now. But ultimately, we all have some. She, for example, doesn’t like animals. From the beginning, admittedly, she didn’t know that it is a flaw. It seemed to her that it was only a neutral trait. Just like any other. Some people like blue, others red, some the sea, others mountains, some Bach, others ukulele. As many tastes as there are people. But soon it became clear that it was not true. The dislike of animals is not an ordinary trait, but a specific flaw and no woman with whom that information was shared, had no doubt about it. <br />    “You don’t like animals?!” they asked more or less scared / disappointed / shocked. At first she shrugged her shoulders, which also turned out to be an inadequate response. In time she simply stopped admitting to this “flaw”.<br />    The segregation of rubbish though, that was a completely different matter. After all, he didn’t do it on purpose, let alone maliciously. He knew, nevertheless, that recyclable stuff needs to be separated from the normal rubbish. What’s more, they had hanged in the kitchen a colour poster prepared by the city, where it is very clear that paper, plastic and metal go to the red; glass to green and the rest to black. It’s really not so hard! And it is impossible that he has not read this leaflet. Although sometimes, when she brought full bags to the rubbish bin, she started to doubt. In any case she repacked everything and segregated again. So that everything would be fine. She even had gloves hidden between the rubbish bins so not to dirty her hands. Each time when she returned, she promised herself that she’ll order him to memorize the leaflet, and then she’ll conduct tests. Of course, all these thoughts passed immediately after returning home. It took just one look at his angelic, innocent face. You don’t give tests to such guys. Such guys we thank that we can be in their presence. Moreover, he also does not ask what I am doing for so long at the rubbish bin. But given that the situation is constantly repeating, perhaps he is beginning to suspect some dark secret. <br />    Once, when she drove him to work one morning, she thought that she’ll trick him. Without looking him in the face - after all, she couldn’t look, because she had to be a vigilant participant in road traffic - she tried to ask a question:<br />    “Damn it” she started, because she didn’t know how to get started, “could you remind me... rubbish... glass we throw to the red...?”<br />    Full of sympathy he burst out laughing, as only he is able to do.<br />    “Don’t tell me...” he began, when he finally stopped laughing. And she felt that his laughter lasts through all eternity. “Well don’t tell me, that you don’t remember?” <br />    “No I’m serious” she tried to explain.<br />    “You know what I thought when I first met you? This is a woman that could be my wife. A person who is able to keep the home fires burning and will never make a mistake with sorting rubbish...”<br />    “You never told me that.”<br />    “Because it’s stupid. To fall in love with a woman who knows how to segregate rubbish? Even I could not think of something that stupid...” <br />    His coyness, the ability to stir emotions by mixing truth and fabrication. She loved this about him very much. Sometimes she wanted to cry when she thought about it. The world, which created such a miraculous being as he, could not be so bad, although he usually had such an official opinion about the world. <br />    She was tormented by the question: Why: if you thought so - since you know that it is important to me - why do you never do it? But she didn’t dare ask him. Besides, was this a matter of courage? After all, would he be hurt by it? Was she afraid that if her boyfriend finds out, that there is something that he does not do perfectly, that he’ll start to suspect that she does not love him completely and irrevocably? She had to be afraid though of something.<br />    When she went to work, she began to think about it. Maybe out of love for him she should drop the topic of segregating rubbish? Eventually people can change. If this is to stand on the path to their love, she should suppress her passion for segregation. If your hand causes you to sin, cut it off, was bouncing around in the back of her head. Probably someone famous said that. Maybe Sting? Or Bono? He often comes out with such preaching texts. <br />    When she returned home a sumptuous dinner was waiting for her. Sometimes he made such surprises for her. She was happy. This time he started the conversation.<br />    “For some time something in our relationship bothers me...”<br />    She was scared of those words. What was coming didn’t look good.<br />    “And I think that is something that I should I tell you.”<br />    She remained silent, but now she was really scared. She knew a lot about him - what socks he likes to wear, the nickname kids gave him in elementary school, she knew all his passwords - and if she didn’t know something, it had to be something in the style of: I’m a robot for American intelligence services; I come from Krypton and they sent me to earth to prepare for a space invasion...<br />    The truth, as always, proved to be much more trivial.<br />    “I’m colour blind, that’s why I have a problem with segregating rubbish. Simply I don’t know which container is which.”<br />    The next day she changed the coloured stickers on the bins for infographics. Unfortunately, it evidently turned out that daltonism was not the cause of his lack of segregation. </p><br />"

			"body":"<p>There is a quite large group of people who apparently have problems sleeping. When after a day of life’s struggles the night comes. The curtain of awareness falls and they are haunted by their dreams. Dreams, as dreams, show up uninvited. The light goes out and under the lowered eyelids begins the projection. These people usually associate their night visions with uncommon imagination, although their causes should be traced to uncomfortable beds or eating in the evening foods of questionable quality. And there would not be anything wrong with it, if the contents of the night’s phantasmagoria didn’t decide to show up in the environment the next day.<br />In their dreams people have supernatural powers, they are travelling to remote corners of galaxies, they meet strange characters, often demons from the past, or get mixed up in situations in which even philosophers have never dreamed of. Such dreams have not been dreamed of by philosophers, because as a rule dreams are based on a scenario with a defective construction. This is the overwhelming majority of class B horror movies, cheap romance novels and science fiction writers on acid. And in the end... Ha! If there is an end. In the vast majority of cases the tension that is built up in the listeners is brutally interrupted by the standard: “And then I woke up!”. As if someone pulled the plug from the wall socket while watching TV. The master of suspense of a plot without sense.<br />Is this at all in accordance with human rights, that another human being would torture the digestive processes of another’s mind? Expelling the contents of plots that were loosely joined together during the night on a random victim? Because do you care that, for example, last night I dreamed that...<br />Waking up in the morning, with horror I discovered that my profile was missing, actually two – my left and right. I also didn’t have any hands or feet. Nothing. I woke up as a great wrinkle. What would an abnormal size wrinkle remind you of? I’ll leave it to your imagination.<br />I had to look for help. I went therefore to the drugstore in the hope that I can find something that will cause my problem to disappear. In hope that it will disappear, means - I will return to the old human form, not at all that I’ll disappear from the face of the earth. I was greeted by all types of creams standing on the shelves, who seeing my miserable posture, began to flex like bodybuilders during a competition.<br />“Choose me! Take me! Here I am!” they shouted.<br />“What you have to offer?” I asked, thereby causing a flow of words.<br />The lids started to show their interiors, the masks started to show their faces and the tubes started to blow. The words they threw out began to merge into hyaluronicing-micro-macro-lifting-moisturizing-matifying-fast absorbing, with liquid laser formula, with particles, firming gibberish. It is sad to discover that even in a dream my ability to make a binding decision teeters on the border of failure.<br />Suddenly, however, I felt that someone is tapping my shoulder, which after all I don’t have, because I converted into the form of a great wrinkle, but it’s only a dream. I turn around and see a Blue Angel with a Swan under his arm.<br />“Who are you, may I ask?”<br />“I am the Blue Angel and this is Nordic Swan. We are markings of ecological products, which considering your total and undeniable ignorance have decided to leave the package in order to protect you from the manipulation of those products here. Will you allow this Greek chorus to seduce you? Hamartia!”<br />“Get lost, blue dish-rag!” the greasy tribune said with one voice. “Behind us stand large corporations, efficacy studies, safety of use. No one is producing us in a garage.”<br />“Marketing gibberish” snapped the Blue Angel. “Show proof!”<br />Wanting to ignore provocation, the cosmetics, whistling, began turning their back on me, which only made ​​the situation worse, because with a person it is a non-verbal affront, while cream has the truth written about itself in small print. Realizing the situation, the cosmetics turned around violently and in a huge commotion began to knock each other off the shelves.<br />“Yes! Fall, you dubious consistency” the angel shouted. “The only thing that you know how to do is get stuck in toxic compounds. And the only thing that stands behind you are slogans written by paid copywriters.”<br />“I am bio!” one of them said indignantly, banging on its lid.<br />“And I’m natural, eco-friendly!” echoed another one which was rolling around.<br />“This” snorted the angel, “is an empty declaration, here what counts is certification! Aside from being big talkers, are you also tested? You know how much effort is needed for me to envelop a product with my angelic care? Empty verbiage is not enough here! Not all markings are equal! You know what those like me - the Blue Angel, Nordic Swan, Ecocert, Cosmebio, and European Daisy - make the best of the best? It is that we are not everywhere or for everyone! We are a reward for the efforts in meeting the stringent environmental requirements. And you hustlers tested on animals, scented with synthetic fragrances, petro-chemical coloured, in your pretty costumes disinfected during radioactive exposure, do you have within you even a thread of environmentalism? You say that you are bio. Where is your five per cent of all raw materials and at least fifty per cent of raw materials of plant origin from certified ecological crops? You say that you are ecological. Do you have in you ten per cent of all and ninety five per cent of raw materials of plant origin from certified ecological crops?”<br />“You eco-leftist! We’ll still win, for people will believe in any advertising nonsense, in order to, no offense” directed to me, “not look like one big wrinkle. Because you are a wrinkle, aren’t you? Or are you looking for the section with preparations for disease of the...”<br />According to the already mentioned scheme - I then woke up. What do you think? This dream means anything to you? No? It should.</p><br />"

			"body":"<p>“It will become waste / it’s an integral step / in the life cycle of almost every / prooooduuuct” screamed from the small stage of the claustrophobic club Arthur, the vocalist of the punk band Sons of Monkeys, shouting the next words with the fury of a pneumatic hammer crushing concrete.<br />“Prooooduuuct” echoed his enthusiastic audience.<br />“Prooooduuuct, which sooner / or later / will be withdrawn from uuuuuse” continued the singer.<br />This was not their first performance in Grudziądz, but probably the first in which such a numerous audience attended electrified by their performance. The Sons of Monkeys were not always a successful band. In their not so long history they had played at weddings, and even entertained at corporate integration trips for telemarketers from the vindication department. When one of the mobile telephone operators decided to prove that a pickle jar is biodegradable, and specifically decided to eat it, with the universal delight of his colleagues, the band decided to evacuate. A pendrive was left to fulfil the role of a DJ. Probably no one even noticed the difference.<br />But everything changed after appearing on the TV show Everyone Can Sing, where they presented the pro-ecology song called Waste, arranged for a banjo and ukulele. The song quickly became a hit on national radio stations, which usually are reluctant to play Polish music.   The ecological message resounded in village clubs and summer festivals. Maybe the popularity of the song was influenced by the fact that it was during the period of introducing the controversial rubbish law. Waste was on everyone’s lips.<br />Arthur managed to get off the stage, but squealing girl fans who were grabbing his hands, as well as other parts of the body, made it difficult for him. Somehow though he slipped backstage, followed by the rest of the band. A problem occurred though when it turned out that in order to use the toilet, you have to go through the main club hall. The crowd thinned out a bit, and the emotions cooled down, but Arthur didn’t yet close the door to the bathroom when he was stopped by a small blonde. She looked modest, but Arthur knew that he couldn’t escape her. And any begging or excuses that he must go to the toilet won’t help.<br />“So what can we do as buyers of products?” the girl asked slyly, referring to the words of their most famous song.<br />“Oh”, Arthur did not feel so comfortable in the role of an authority, but he couldn’t refuse giving her an answer, “we can be aware of...” he began and leaned against the wall. Only now he realized how very tired he is.<br />“Yes?”<br />“We can be aware that by selecting a new product, we should be guided by not only its content and price, but also the packaging.”<br />“Don’t you feel sometimes a product?” the brilliant blonde asked disturbingly.<br />Arthur didn’t reply. He only slightly tilted his head, trying to get a better look at her.<br />“Don’t you feel sometimes a product?” she repeated the question, though his elementary school teacher told them not once or twice that a given question repeated twice is a sign of mild intellectual impairment.<br />“That’s what I’m asking” reiterated the girl, who apparently never heard such words of wisdom.<br />“Maybe I feel. But you know...”<br />“I don’t know” she replied, and he thought that they always do this. They say that they don’t know, although they know.<br />“Well, we’ll use a product for a shorter or longer period, depending on its nature, however, the first thing we have after we unpack it is waste.”<br />“Are you talking about yourself or about other products?” The girl was far too resolute.<br />“Do you think that I am extraordinary?” Arthur decided to cleverly change the subject.<br />“I think that we are all simultaneously ordinary and extraordinary. We all produce waste. The question is, what do we do with it later?”<br />“That’s right. We should pay attention to the packaging. Sometimes we want to sell something so much that we forget that what is on the inside is what counts, and not on the outside. Oh and ecological” Arthur began to wind up, finally realizing that she really knows everything, and is asking only to check him.<br />“Will you show me what you have inside? What lies underneath your packaging?” she suddenly asked.<br />Arthur didn’t know what to say, so he only embarrassingly smiled.<br />“Of course, I don’t want you to throw it away. Soon you’ll be able to hide under it again” she added and took him by the hand.<br />Arthur completely forgot that he wanted to go to the bathroom. He allowed her to lead. They left the club. Grudziądz at night seemed to be mysterious and alluring. Arthur didn’t know what would come out of it. Where would this all lead him? Well. They were ecological, and their destiny was to become rubbish. Only faith remained that they wouldn’t be discarded anytime soon only out of material boredom. And even if it does happen, then at another time, someone else, somewhere else, again will want to use them.</p><br />"

			"body":"<p>I’m lying in the sun. More like I’m melting. Very nice. If that is what a sausage on the grill feels, then sitting with a bare bottom on a grate wouldn’t be a great tragedy. Only what for this prison pattern? It’s like sunbathing through the bars of my own cell, and there’s not much more to say about it. </p><br /><br /><p>I’m lying in the sun. I’m turning like a human shish kebab around my own axis. The sun travels with an arc around the sky. I’m turning like I’m impaled on an invisible stick. And together we are turning slowly. It’s as our complex machinery set the whole world in motion, and yet nothing happens. I’m not turning this world. It’s turning itself.</p><br /><br /><p>Lying on my back, I tilt my head back. It looks as if the sea and the sky changed their places. But they didn’t change, otherwise the water, which by melting glaciers is increasing, would overflow the planet and we would probably be left with empty holes from the seas and oceans. And what would we do with those holes? The fish would die, even if all of humanity would begin giving mouth-to-mouth. Maybe we would get accustomed to it? These waters now aren’t clean anyways. What’s the difference - breathing dirty oxygen from the water or from the air?  I have no idea. Such a fish has little joy in life. At the most if bait somehow slips off the hook and the fish escapes with it in its mouth. As a result many a fishermen under their moustaches have let out insults. Well, we have two escapees. The fish and the insult. Both died in the depths of the waters. It’s all without sense. Well, getting back to my senses. Is every part of my divine body tanned?</p><br /><br /><p>I take off my bikini. I start to look it over. A little bit out of boredom, but also because all the rotating has began to make me feel a little sick. A bikini is not a book - there is only the tag to read. So what?! 100% polyester! In other words - to call a spade a spade - non-renewable petroleum! Looking at the towel - the same thing! I’m covered in oil! Like those birds from the Gulf of Mexico. And not only me. Everyone at their own request is immersed in crude oil. Daily we are drowning in it from our socks to our buttons. It’s enough to state that from this the testosterone level drops and as if those on towels next to me got colder. After all, its “cotton - cotton - cotton”. More! Organic cotton, meaning the cotton among cottons. That which has never seen pesticides and fertilisers on its fibres. What’s more, it’s from Fair Trade, meaning nobody in China or Bangladesh was hurt by it. I want to see organic cotton on the labels! I want to be clothed in that! Polyester doesn’t really appeal to the eyes. It’s a bit annoying in the degradation stage, if it’s not taken for recycling. Maybe better viscose? Supposedly artificial, but has properties similar to cotton. Supposedly chemically produced, but from renewable raw materials. I don’t know. Instead of reading a label, I’d rather read a colourful magazine, even about fishing. Supposedly there was a time when it was forbidden to throw magazines in containers for recycled waste paper. At least that is what I heard, that a magazine is not a newspaper. And what is it supposedly? It does not matter, especially since recently they relaxed a bit. That’s good! Because soon this segregation despair will cause a person to get into a container himself and lay down in it. But which one? Hmm. My divine body is tanned all over. Fortunately, man is fully biodegradable, unless a person enlarges something. I confess immodestly - don’t need to. </p><br /><br /><p>But first things first. I should start by emptying my pockets: <br />Phone? Electro rubbish, so to the junk truck. <br />Poop bag? For the dog of course! - plastic.<br />Unpaid credit card? As above.<br />Non-virtual money? Banknotes are waste paper, but not coins. After all, coins are metal.<br />Breath mints? I would have eaten them, so they don’t count on the list. </p><br /><br /><p>And then I’d have to undress. Remove the trouser’s zipper with my teeth, because - just like coins - it’s metal. I don’t know. Maybe it’s better to cut it into cloths?  On TV a lady shows such how to polish furniture with socks, but why does she put them on her hands when she just needs to bend her legs enough? But if the clothes are not destroyed? They can be given away. I can be buried, but someone else will wear it.</p><br /><br /><p>The longer I think about it, the more logical segregation seems to me. As simple as the sun that surrounds my divinely tanned body. Because fortunately I have nothing on me. Completely nothing. Aside from the citation I’m holding in my hand for indecent exposure in a public place. Waste paper? </p><br />"

			"body":"<p>The clock struck twelve. The kindergarten teachers took their crossed-eyed kids with missing teeth and Paula continued to sit on the Poznan market. Apathetically chewing a piece of Margherita pizza she observed the crowd moving down the crooked cobblestones. She was not in a hurry to get back to the suffocating office and computer. She could not fathom what was in these people, that in such a heat they would want to try on, browse, compare and buy. After all, all those bags with known brands, which the tourists paraded around with in the city was evidence of such.<br />She had no such desire. Stand in the queues and inhale fumes from the air conditioning? Oh, anything but that. Paula was an open and modern person. At least that is what she liked to think about herself, spending evenings shopping over the Internet. It’s no big deal that another pair of trousers was not needed. Miss such an opportunity? It would be a sin committed against one’s own appearance! Oh, that cream - fifty per cent cheaper than in the stop, and twice the size. At least when you look at the packaging, but again, people can’t be trusted. In the past a package brought by the courier, although the box was the size of a washing machine, contained only a microscopic jar. And even that was only filled half way. Paula did not even suspected that by paying for that little bit of cream, she was really paying for the packaging. She put the blame on fraudulent corporations and did not think about it anymore.<br />Anyway, it was like that yesterday. After returning from work the long expected package with the new phone was waiting for her. Beautiful, pink and thin as a bookmark. However, before Paula got to it, she fought a lopsided battle for half an hour with the cardboard and tape. She won, but the stacks of blister packs were still piled up around the bed.<br />Now, eating pizza and drinking water from a bottle, she recalled yet other such treasures filling up her kitchen, bathroom and all other areas of her studio. Stacks of read newspaper, hectares of empty water bottles, kilometres of ribbons for gifts and oceans of empty boxes. Yes, that was all there and what’s more very much caught the eyes. Nevertheless, tomorrow - tomorrow! - Sam is coming to her tomorrow. The same Sam who for months made sheep eyes to her and chatted at the coffee machine. The guy for whom she was prepared to invent a story about a broken computer to get him to come over. Ok, she’ll look very pretty in this mess - the true queen of the landfill, and that will be that!<br />Once Paula had the idea that maybe it would be worth using the empty packaging somehow in a creative way. Plants flowers in yogurt containers or something like that. And maybe not take so many disposable plastic bags from the shop when only buying a newspaper. Or buy larger packaging, so not to collect so many bottles. Unfortunately, for the earth and its inhabitants, this thought disappeared as quickly as it appeared.<br />Still looking at the pilgrimage of shoppers on the Poznan square Paula decided: “I’ll tell Sam I broke my leg. Maybe not. It will be difficult to hustle up a cast in so short a time. Perhaps I have such a severe stomach flu that the entire neighbourhood is under quarantine? Or there’s no need to fix the computer because thieves stole it?”.<br />Each one of those thoughts emerging in her mind was more absurd than the previous. But the most absurd idea was the thought that she would single-handedly clean up that mess herself, and by tomorrow. Supposedly how was she supposed to do it? Change a moment into Superman?<br />Despite the stultifying heat, Paula realized that the task of carrying tonnes of empty packaging is Mission Impossible multiplied by Waterloo. The effects of all those evenings spent before the computer screen will not defeat one small woman with two little hands, including one left hand. No, a final solution will be needed here.<br />Moving is not an option. The flat is on credit and with a struggle to pay off. Arson? She might even get compensation, but the risk is too high. Maybe she could apply to a TV program? Or find a miracle worker?<br />Suddenly, a brilliant thought came to Paula’s head: ask Christopher for help. Christopher was her friend from the other side of the desk: a shy introvert who always, when it seemed that Paula didn’t see it, threw her admiring glances from behind his monitor. In addition, he was a vegetarian and some other environmentalist - in fact, the mission of saving the planet was close to his heart. Maybe this and the mission of saving Paula will inspire him to help?<br />Yes, Christopher will know how to get rid of all this junk. To which container to throw plastic, to which paper and what to do with this miserable foil. In addition, he is tall, so it will be easy for him to carry everything from the fourth floor. I’ll tell the poor chap that I collected all this to alleviate mother Earth and force him to silence by a promised dinner or going to the cinema. Only Sam can’t find out.<br />Refreshed with this idea Paula stood up from the table and started walking. Pushing through the crowd of tourists, she didn’t notice the big, thin guy who for a good half hour observed her from the market arcade. He was just about to follow her when suddenly something vibrated in his shirt pocket.<br />“Hi, this is Christopher. Sure, we can meet in the evening. And you know what? It is no longer valid about that girl from work. We won’t get along. You know, just a moment ago she threw a water bottle into a normal rubbish bin? I’m such a fool. All the time I thought that since a chick pays so much attention to her appearance that she’ll take care of more than just the tip of her nose.”</p><br />"

			"body":"<p>“This is old” my daughter Susie said, shaking her head. <br />“It is” I nodded, “It is old. Her name is Lola.” <br />“Why do I need this old rag?” she asked, adding “You promised me new Pet Shops.” <br />“I thought that I already bought for you all of them that there are?” I replied, in accordance with the truth. I really thought so. For the cavalry of coloured, plastic ponies laying around in her room one could go on a nice vacation. <br />“All the time new ones are coming out” she asserted, unmoved. <br />Once again I showed her the doll, if it was the most valuable discovery in the world. The fact was that it was old and ugly as sin. But it belonged to her grandmother, and in contrast to the regiment of Pet Shops set on the cabinet, it had already been in this world for a few decades. <br />“It’s washed. The clothes are washed too. It’s almost as good as new” I said. <br />“I don’t need it” she replied, with the specific type of determination, which only a six year old could generate. <br />“Do you need all these things?” I asked, waving my hand around her room and the pile of strewn around toys, dolls, teddy bears, blocks and action figures, which of course had to be more than all her friends as well as books and plastic buckets. <br />Everyone buys their kids tonnes of toys. It’s normal. But it did not change the fact that Peter and I overdid it. <br />“Yes” she said and sat down on the floor, with a look on her face, like a true general who is about to defend his army to the last drop of blood. Now I realized that the conversation awaiting me is not going to be easy. I sat on the floor in front of her. I laid Lola next to me. I pulled out this eyesore after ten years of lying in the attic in the very middle of a strong debate. I felt stupid. <br />“Susie” I said to her, letting out a deep breath. It was hard for me, I had a dry throat. <br />“Yes” my daughter responded, confirming that she heard me, looking me deep in the eyes. <br />“Susie” I asked, “how many of these things are you really using?” <br />“All of them” she said, tightening her mouth. <br />“All? Some of these things we bought you some four years ago. Do you really want to say that the toys for two year olds are still the hit of the season?” <br />“Age does not matter” said my daughter. <br />I looked at the pile of toys in a plastic basket from Ikea in the corner of the room. There were quite a few of such baskets in my daughter’s room, and all of them were full to the brim. I went to it and began to rummage through it. My daughter very carefully watched my every move; not taking her eyes off me. One after another I took out monkeys, dolls, toy instruments, books for reading as well as various creatures of unknown species and colours. <br />I stopped at the soft material crocodile, filled with foam, with a fairly stupid, though pretentious look. <br />“What’s his name?” I asked Susie, waving the docile reptile before her eyes. <br />“Lester” she declared, after a moment of hesitation. I knew it was a lie. <br />“Lester” I nodded, “that’s strange. From what I remember, he was called Bob.” <br />“Well, maybe he is Bob” she replied, visibly nervous now. <br />“Susie” again I sat in front of her. “I found Bob a week ago squeezed under our bed. Judging by the amount of dust that covered him, he was lying there for a month.”<br />“He got lost” stated Susie, explaining the situation very quickly. <br />I nodded. Without standing, I threw Lester in the plastic container across the room. <br />“Susie, I brought this doll not to tell you to play with it right now” I said, again lifting up Lola. “I understand that she is not really for showing off.”<br />Lola really was not for showing off. Her plastic eyes were obviously cross-eyed. The wavy, gold hair looked more like the lush head of hair of an Italian tenor than a small child. The dress pattern was dangerously similar to a tablecloth in a roadside diner and the mouth formed a grimace that should resemble a smile, but in reality brought to mind a toothache. <br />“It looks terrible” said Susie. <br />“Well, you’re right, a little bit” I nodded. “But that’s not the point. The thing is that your grandmother had just a few dolls and teddy bears. And Lola was one of them.” <br />“When grandmother was small, there was no money. You said yourself.” <br />“Well, there was some, but Susie, it’s not about the money. The point is that toys need to be produced somewhere. In factories that pollute the environment. They consume gasoline. Then these toys are exported to countries where parents, like us, buy for kids, like you, tonnes of such toys. Most of these toys after half a year are totally unnecessary. Finally they land in the rubbish.” <br />“You want to throw my toys away?” On the face of my daughter appeared a red alarm. The crying was coming - inevitable, unstoppable, like a rainstorm. <br />“No, I don’t want to, God forbid” I replied. “I don’t want to throw them away.” But just think for a moment, do you really need to have so many Pet Shops, which in a moment you will not even play with. <br />“But I will play with them for two months” my daughter declared. <br />“That would be a record” I replied. <br />I got up, leaving Lola on the carpet. I looked at Susie. She sat motionless, with clenched lips, but it did not seem like she was about to cry. She rather looked like someone who thought intensively. <br />I was about to exit the room, leaving her with Lola, factories, Bob and all the bits and pieces. I knew that her clever, six year old mind will need a little time to deal with it. I was opening the door when she called to me: <br />“Mum.” <br />I turned around. <br />“Mummy, how many of these factories are there?” she asked. <br />“A lot. They are huge” I said. <br />“As big as Warsaw?” she asked. <br />“Yes, some are even bigger” I replied. <br />“And they really pollute the environment? Those factories? They poison trees and water?” <br />I nodded. Susie also nodded her head. We stood there for a moment, as if we were both trying to come to terms with the undeniable fact. Susie picked up Lola from the floor for a moment and then put her down again. <br />“Forty-two” she said. <br />“What do you mean forty-two?” as I wrinkled my eyebrows. My daughter sometimes could make me feel like in the film “The Shining”. <br />“Forty-two Pet Shops,” she declared, looking at the cabinet. “That should be enough.” <br />I smiled at her and she smiled back. Lola, lying on a carpet, had one eye on her and another on me, as if she wanted to make sure that we really worked things out. </p><br />"
