			"body":"The door bell rang and she knew that it was too late. The plane left without her. The alarm clock in the new phone instead of a ringtone with the power of Rammstein apparently tried to wake her up with something similar to melody good for a cat. No, rather not. Think again. Tiger was also asleep, which she guessed by feeling something warm and fluffy close to her right foot. Did she really need to buy that new phone?! Did I, seriously?! Yes, he cleverly it to sold her. The guy in the shop rather than put any effort with who knows what, simply took her picture. One photo was enough to ignite the wild desire to have a phone immediately producing such miracles. Stupid Instagram, stupid filters and stupid salesman. And she was the stupidest in this all. That it looked like something from a kid’s program? That there wasn’t even one wrinkle? So what?! The times of Anne of Green Gables should always remain there where it belongs - on the junk pile, together with old VCRs and walkmans. And now everything is lost. There won’t be the hot beach, no drinks with an umbrella and also no handsome Greek.Who’s banging at the door? Indeed, one can’t even feel sorry about one’s fate in peace and quiet. Where’s the fire? One would be able to smell the smoke, but here in the air was only bitterness and disappointment. Probably the neighbour again from flat number four forgot to turn off the water and now it is pouring on the tiles in her bathroom and the new washing machine that she especially bought for the cat. “You’ll get rid of all that cat hair and you’ll never find even a single hair on your clothes!”. What a joke. Yesterday none of her black T-shirts were fit to show people, not to mention co-workers. If she had known that it will be like this, she would have never dreamed about the nightmare of carrying the old washing machine down from the fourth floor and replacing it with a new one, carrying it supposedly along the same route, but feeling like it was twice as long. Do washing machines really have to weigh so much? Can’t they make them from some cosmic materials from NASA, like they show on Discovery? Anyway, the old washing machine was better. A person knew what to expect and didn’t have unnecessary illusions. In addition, somehow it used less electricity. Maybe from this A++ on the door?In her thoughts she counted all the equipment which recently cluttered her microscopic flat. Toaster - one. Microwave - two. TV, washing machine, dish washer - another three. God, it would be enough not just for Chalkidiki but for Hollywood! A person would walk around like Marilyn under palm trees and grin with an American smile. But instead one’s left in Warsaw with a loan to pay off and a flooded bathroom. Now all that is left is to reheat toast in the microwave and stare at the beach on the TV.Stupid, stupid, stupid! After all, the old equipment wasn’t so old and secondly they worked like they should. Well, almost, but it was no great tragedy. And now they are rusting somewhere and emitting asbestos or other harmful garbage. What is causing her eyes to suddenly sting? No, maybe something is on fire. Go Tiger and check, ok? Mommy still wants to weep for a moment over the injustice and callousness of the world.For example, the old phone. It rang, loud enough to wake the dead! That it was a little scratched? So what. If every scratched thing was discriminated against, she wouldn’t have enough for makeup and cotton swabs. Therefore this Greece appeared, for supposedly nothing is seen under a tan. Probably another lie. But it was nice to believe. Cursed Anne of Green Gables syndrome! Get a hold of yourself girl, some things even plaster can’t fix. It’s time to face the morning view in the mirror and not buy any more embroidered cushions, because the design on the cheek doesn’t fade that quickly.By the way, why do only girls have a problem with that? A guy wouldn’t even think of putting cream on his face. Oh, well. If he is under fifty and wears a cap, he can still use his school ID on the bus. And what about her? Like the old phone - scratch on scratch, as if someone drew on glass with a rock.Enough of this! From today, no new junk, no Instagrams and other mixers. We’re going back to basics and shifting into manual mode, Tiger, and that’s all there is to it. The new me and the new cat, but equipment only old and proven. No smartphone will spit in our face and ruin a hard-earned holiday! There will be no more unnecessarily discarded phones contributing to the destruction of the planet! It will be conscious and environmental. To get off to a good start we’ll replace the doorbell. We mount a knocker or something. Enough of terror and poisonous impulses in one’s own home!Whew, her humour at once improved and everything seemed to turn green all around.You know what Tiger, I think probably Anna is ringing the doorbell. She was to take you for two weeks, while I was to be frying like bacon on the beach. So I guess I’ll get up and open the door, huh? What do you think, can I still rebook the plane ticket? That new phone has, I think, such a function."

			"title":"A dog’s day",
			"youtube":"",
			"body":"My parents left me the dog. They left on holiday to warm countries, and me - a representative of corporate slaves with holidays “as soon as there will be a little slack” they sponsored ten days alone with a monster. Supposedly nothing - just a little poodle, in fact a miniature. Only that my previous contact with this poodle was limited to several long weekends and holidays. The dog, probably not accustomed to me, fell into depression and I couldn’t convince her to eat any food left by her holidaying master. Neither groats from neighbouring Lubelski fields, nor ecologically raised chicken, nor even carrots, which were grown without any pesticides. If it continues going like this, I shall have on my conscience both the animal and my mother when she returns.Explaining it all to the dog didn’t help. The dog, actually a bitch with the beautiful name of Daisy, only looked at me like I was crazy. It is likely, moreover, that she may have a point. Kneeling on the floor next to the bowl, with a pleading look on my face, I was reminded of that crazy crone who in the fairy tales fattened children with sweets. I didn’t suspect that the dog was familiar with it and was afraid that she will finish like they did, in the oven (but of course there was a happy end), but you never know. Daisy is smart beast and maybe she heard this somewhere.Returning though to the problem. The day passed and not one morsel disappeared from the bowl. The dog probably didn’t lose any weight on this account, but under that fur it is difficult to guess. Maybe I should get the advice of an expert? I turned on the comp and voilà! Good uncle Google states that when a dog gets hungry, it will start to eat. Apparently he hasn’t heard yet about Daisy. What will happen if she doesn’t start? If she has anorexia or, God forbid, twisted bowels because of this hunger? “You know, Mum, Daisy didn’t make it till your return, but don’t worry, I’ll buy you a new dog”. Seriously, uncle good advice? You try telling her that!Never mind. Apparently she does not like the taste of chicken with carrots. So what that this is ecological, from local production and without preservatives. How do poodles know that such food is, in the first place, healthier, and secondly, don’t ruin the planet. Thinking about the secrets of dog breeding, I go to the pet shop for food. I come back, pour in the bowl and wait. The dog comes, sniffs and grimaces so cruelly, that if I did not see it myself, I wouldn’t believe it. Daisy, I beg you a hundredfold, please don’t do this. See what good dog food there is, colourful and smells good. Do you know how many dogs suffer from famine in Africa? How many don’t even have a bowl to lick? Eat at least a little.The dog sticks out her tongue as a demonstration and leaves, while I begin to read the label. Look: cereals, meat, animal products, fats, vegetables. What’s the matter? Sounds like recipe for dinner that I could eat myself. I read on: mineral substances, protein and calcium. Well, animals also need vitamins. After all, this glossy fur doesn’t come from tap water. Copper sulphate, manganese sulphate, zinc sulphate... oh my gosh! That was close. I almost stuffed an innocent dog with the entire Mendeleev’s table! I’m sorry, Daisy. I had no idea what was in this dog food. Well, it’s good that you did not eat it, because you could even begin to shine. In the end, we are what we eat, right?I placed the bowl full of toxic fumes near the rubbish bin. Mum taught that even such food cannot be thrown away, so at least let the neighbourhood cats think it over. If they have any instinct of self-preservation, they’ll avoid it like the plague and there won’t be any casualties.With wisdom gained from a chemistry set as a kid, I decided to act in accordance with my own eating patterns. I also don’t like groats, so why should I be surprised at the dog? Therefore today, Daisy, I am making dinner. The first course: ecological lentils with curry. On the table straight from a farmer I know, who has all the certificates. The curry is not from the farmer, but it was also grown without degradation to the environment. Next: fresh fish in butter with thyme. Don’t worry, Daisy. This time I’ll read all the labels before I buy. They wrote with the smallest fonts, but I squinted and somehow struggled through it so there wouldn’t be another disaster. I had enough strength left to choose ice cream for dessert. Sounds tasty? Ok Daisy, let’s get to work.After two hours the kitchen looked like a battlefield, and me, Frankenstein’s sister with the announced meal - closer to an unidentified substance. However, Daisy didn’t look like anything, because simply she was not there. Nowhere. My desperate cries, pleas and requests were for nothing. The dog disappeared. Evaporated into thin air. Looking around I remembered what works for this nasty poodle. The lead! It was enough to take it off the hook, and the dog stood at the door like a sprinter ready to run. That’s right, but apparently the lead grew legs. Is today really a day of disappearing dogs and their accessories? Where could I have put it?Take it easy. Calm down girl and remind yourself, step by step, what you did. Ok, I returned from the shop, opened the door and carried the groceries to the kitchen. Daisy did not get under my feet and, therefore, she didn’t return with me. And since she didn’t return, she is still there, that poor thing, tied up next to the shop.After ten minutes of murderous physical effort, apologizing to the dog in all ways possible and tears shed over my own recklessness we both returned to the house. Immediately after entering Daisy ran to the bowl and engulfed her chicken with groats. Then with style the miniature poodle went to the bedroom, leaving me in complete shock. Was uncle Google right or did my cooking scare her?"

			"youtube":"",
			"body":"Inside the wardrobe there was unusual excitement as for this time of year. Instead of summer stagnation, for all the furs were protected in plastic covers with mothballs, there was the best July night fever between the clothes hangers.“Maurice, Maurice!” An excited voice echoed in the darkness. “Look at the cotton she bought! A beauty! Straight from a plantation in Alabama, naturally grown and unsprayed.Maurice Moth flew closer and carefully observed the label on the green dress. (It’s a myth that moths are blind as moles. They see as good as bats in the dark. Or maybe owls?). Luckily, Maurice was able to decipher and even spell:“One hundred per cent organic cotton. Made in the USA.”“Ho, ho, high fashion! By the looks Calvin Klein, by the smell second-hand.”Both of these names were the sweetest music to his ears. (One should know that Maurice has an aristocratic background and he had a fussy and delicate taste).“Gustav, we have a unique opportunity to experience art in its pure form!”Gustav was perhaps not so experienced as his friend was, but he recognised a good thing spot on. However, in order not to give the impression of being a thick-skinned glutton, he began modestly, from the collar.“Mmm, delicious. Handmade, no industrial Chinese product.”Suddenly a piece of the collar got stuck in his throat at Maurice’s disgusted look.“W-h-a-t?”“Gustav, eating such a beautiful dress is a manifestation of barbarism for the world of people and insects! Look here: the label has a symbol of a sphere with a kind of eye in the middle, under which it reads that this is a fair trade product. Do you know what that means? Of course, you don’t. It means nothing more or less than thanks to this cotton that you are now chewing, our brothers in the Third World may enjoy the taste of school uniforms! That’s right, Gustav. Indeed, it means that products with this symbol have been produced without using child labour, without exploiting fairly paid workers and with respect for the natural environment. Money from the sale of this cotton went to social initiatives, such as the said school.”Gustav was so overwhelmed that a flake of cotton fell out of his mouth, even though he is not so sensitive.“That’s not all that you don’t know about this beautiful dress, Gustav. I guess you have already sensed its delicate scent, similar to the smell of a cat and old vase water. Well, first of all this smell indicates that the dress is vintage and thus environmentally friendly and economical. Second of all: it has been rarely washed, so no detergent is wasted to destroy all of us. Dirt, dear Gustav, has a great future! Each washing decreases the quality of clothes and increases its susceptibility to further contamination. In addition, washing machines used by humans are real beasts, devouring electricity and water to the detriment of our insect world! Will you deny it, Gustav?”Gustav did not want to deny, because the vision of an electricity devouring beast paralysed not only his tongue.“So, let’s move on.” Maurice took a breath of fresh air and continued with a bass voice: “This green colour was not created in the laboratory of a chemist, but on the palette of an artist like Leonardo. Of course, dear Gustav, you have no idea who Leonardo was. I assure you, though, that what you are trying to feast on, not only looks like grass, but it also tastes like grass. There are no pesticides or other disgusting things, only ecological colouring in harmony with nature.Not knowing why, somehow for Gustav the word “nature” resulted in a strong desire for immediate evacuation - leaving the dress, the wardrobe and the entire lecture. He had just lifted his wings to fly, when Maurice suddenly said something that stunned him for good.“But the most important reason why we cannot even lick this dress is our conscience. No need to blush Gustav. I’ve discovered a long time ago, that in fact you are a decent insect, Gustav. Now conscience - Yes! Conscience! We would choke if we destroyed such a beautiful thing by simple gluttony. Old and molted furs - you can. Patched woollen sweaters and gloves - no problem. Worn-out coats and hats - bon appetite, my friend. We wouldn’t harm anyone, because sooner or later they would end up in a container for worn-out clothing. However, investing in a famous designer - that’s a completely different story.Frankly, Gustav was already tired of everything. He was tired of the designers, organic cotton plantations, and even this dress. But since his conscience was exposed, he had to play his role to the end.“So, this means that we are not eating, right? Perhaps just the sleeves, long sleeves aren’t needed in such heat ...”“Where is your honour, Gustav?!” Maurice roared with rage like a fire siren. “Aren’t you getting anything in your insect brain?”“I am, but slowly, because I’m hungry. I can’t feed on honour, can I?”“You’re wrong again, Gustav. Well, will be having honour for dinner today - Japanese style. I prefer this than let you commit the crime of eating it!”“So, are we are going to eat flip-flops?” Gustav asked confused.“Something much better. Have you ever heard of Harakiri? Come on, let’s fly to that shirt. We’ll have polyester for the last supper.”"

			"title":"Amber, an ordinary bottle",
			"youtube":"",
			"body":"Amber was an ordinary bottle. She was a PET bottle no one usually pays attention to, unless someone wished to drink its content. Traditional polymer bottles, just like Amber, are not biodegradable, which in theory should make her happy. However, Amber was not happy. She felt that there was something wrong with her, something was completely wrong when she was produced. Should it really happen that normal bottles, such as Amber, enjoy almost divine, eternal life? You could bury a bottle in the ground, trodden the soil and after three hundred years dig it up and probably it would still be suitable for use. Is it not a frightening perspective? At any time someone could bury her somewhere and then she would spend all eternity, thinking whether she would ever encounter anything nice. Or would she lie there, buried deep down in the ground, like a pirates’ chest, waiting to be discovered? Waiting for who knows how long until someone finally recycles her. If she really was a pirates’ chest, she would surely increase her chance to be returned to use. But she was just an ordinary plastic bottle which can be found everywhere.This did not seem right to Amber. She often chatted about it with her friend from the shelf, Damian. Damian was not like the other bottles, even though he looked the same. He liked listening to Amber, and in the evenings, when the light was fading in the store, Damian would rub his label against Amber’s bottle cap. It was really nice, Amber thought, though she was ashamed that Damian could not imagine the world outside the warehouse. And yet, Amber believed that the real adventure was out there. They were still young, but the crowd of bottles standing next to them had no understanding for this kind of ambition and perhaps that was the reason why Damian resisted such thoughts. He said that anything that is important is in the warehouse. Besides, there are only other warehouses outside, so what is the point of moving from where they are warm and dry. And then Damian told a story of a bottle, which rolled outside and she was brought back after a few days, all trembling, dirty and with a scratched bottom. She couldn’t say what happened to her. She was only good for the trash bin now.Despite the resistance of some of the bottles, the fact was that the Big Exit did happen from time to time. None of the bottles knew where their friends were really being taken. Stories about a new, wonderful life, full of luxurious refrigerators between palm trees mixed with dark stories about the Final Bottle Solution. The truth, however, remained unknown. No bottle has ever returned to the warehouse to tell the others what awaits them. It was, of course, grist to the mill for pessimists but it did not depress the optimists. “Why would they come back if the outside was so wonderful?” they argued in response.When the time came for the forklift to take the pallet where Amber, Damian and the others lived, Amber welcomed the moment with excitement, but also fear. Finally, they’ll know what’s on the other side. They were loaded on a trailer without windows and so their first journey began. Amber was never good at geography (why would she be, apparently no one cared about the education of plastic bottles), but Amber could bet that they travelled hundreds, if not hundreds of thousands of kilometres. This gave her courage. If they were really so unimportant, as some older bottles argued, would someone take them on such a long journey? If they were to be disposed of, it could be done just around the corner. If someone was taking them so far away, apparently their lives had some deeper meaning.In the shop, where the bottles were placed, everything was wonderfully different. Amber knew that there are other products in the world aside from bottles. But she never imagined that there were so many! Looking at them from the third shelf in the “Beverages” section Amber was wondering what type of life they might have, what they desire, what happens to them? She couldn’t wait for all these conversations and new experiences, but before Amber dared to start a conversation with anyone, someone’s hand grabbed her and threw her into the cart between other products. No one knew where they were being taken. Besides, there was no special time for speculations, because after a while she again found herself in the back of a car. It was dark and cold, and Damian was left alone on the shelf. Amber did not even have time to say goodbye to him, she did not even have time to think about it. Everything happened so fast. Amber began talking with other products. It turned out that the world is full of warehouses similar to the one in which Amber lived. In fact, the products were not aware that there was another world behind the warehouse doors. Well, of course, there was the shop to which they were all destined. But not much more. “Warehouses, shops and travelling back and forth” Amber thought. It had little to do with the adventures that Amber had imagined.Suddenly, someone started rummaging in the bag where Amber was, grabbed her really firm, and opened the bottle. He pressed his lips to her neck, but Amber immediately realised that it was not true love. After a few seconds, she was empty inside. Amber felt so useless and unnecessary as never before.Apparently, Amber was not the only one to feel this way, but also the man who drank so fast. As soon as he finished he screwed the cap back on (as if he didn’t know that crushing a bottle with its cap on requires much more energy) and tossed her out the window. The edge of the road, where she landed, was an interesting variation. But it’s hard to say that it was a positive one. Since the road was deserted, Amber was not much resistant to wind, which easily carried her deeper and deeper in the desert. She was getting dirtier and more battered, and the sun was beating down mercilessly. Each new gust of wind moved Amber further away from civilization and significantly reduced the chance that she will be recycled and start a new, interesting life. When she finally stopped on a pile of rubbish by a fence, she realised that nothing more awaits her. Dirty, tired and useless products did not want to communicate with Amber. Amber was not sure whether they were no longer able to do so or just simply didn’t like strangers. Amber buried herself in the sand, dreaming of a final utilisation, which she will probably never experience."

			"body":"Every cloud has a silver lining Martha thought and wiped the tears from her wet check with the sleeve of the jackets. She was still a little sad, but was slowly calming down. Her hands were still shaking a little, and her eyelids for certain were still swollen, but the feeling of rejection that was pulsating somewhere in the middle of her chest slowly probably had to escape somewhere. Perhaps, she thought, sadness leaves the body with the tears, because the longer she cried, the more it left. She could even stop imagining herself as a haven of peace, a damn laid-back lotus flower on a crystal clear lake. Anyways, it didn’t work out that great. She rather felt like a dead fish laying on the surface of a pool of crude oil. Sticky darkness was all about, the end of which was not in sight. But somewhere a light started to shine. But the question was, is this the light of a lifeboat or rather still only the lights of a sinking tanker?When Martha lost work two months ago in one of the trendy clothing boutiques, located in a big shopping centre on the outskirts of Warsaw, she was convinced that finding new employment would be a matter of days, possibly weeks. The following days and weeks, however, started to brutally verify her view. Although sending her CV went quite well, receiving responses went much worse. Of course, she had no illusions that every potential employer would respond to her. However, the daily check of the inbox, which each time seemed to be more and more empty, turned out to be quite a frustrating task. When at last she was invited for an interview, she was confident that now all will go downhill. After all, how much can one climb? Even the longest climb must come to an end. Even more so that the boutique which responded seemed a great place to work. It advertised as environmentally friendly and selling only ecological products. Martha always worried about the fate of the planet, so she was glad that she could combine business with pleasure. Making money to rescue the planet? Could there be anything better? Well, she imagined, it would be better to save planet without having to earn money. Unfortunately, she had no idea how to rule out this necessity. While at the same time she vaguely sensed that there is a lot of money (too much) in the world, so some of it could at once be transferred to her account , instead of pointlessly travelling the world, from one tax haven to another.The trip to the interview seemed to be much more pleasant than a trip to the post office. The later she knew all too well. However, when she reached the specified address she began to doubt. The shop looked nice. In front of the shop window bloomed aromatic herbs, which was an attractive change for the sterile plant varieties living in air-conditioned shopping centres that had accompanied her so far on her career path. However, she became concerned about the sign placed in one of the shop’s windows: “Cosmetics made from one hundred per cent natural, ecologic materials”. One hundred per cent natural raw material may be peat or other mud, but these are rather not sold in boutiques. Anyways, is today’s mud still one hundred per cent natural? Some acid rain falls a few times and it might turn out that there are more chemicals than in Zyklon B. And, even if such peat did not have any chemical contaminants, there would still be another problem. The packaging would also have to be one hundred per cent natural. That rarely happens. Or maybe these cosmetics would be sold directly into the customer’s hands? Well, possibly a customer could come with her own bucket made from recycling and pick it up that way. However, there is not going to be a queue of women with buckets in front of the shop. On the contrary. The customers visiting the shop rather looked like representatives of the upper middle class. Besides, how should they look like? After all, this was not an open air market in Ciechanów, but an eco boutique in the Żoliborz district. And also one hundred per cent natural? Even the most stringent eco certificates don’t guarantee one hundred per cent. For example, to get such a Cosmebio Eco, ninety-five per cent of raw materials of plant origin used must come from certified ecologic crops. Martha felt that something was not right here, but she went inside.“Do you know what the Blue Angel symbol stands for?” fell the first question, when after a moment of waiting the shop manager invited her to the back room which looked more like a VIP room than a shop storage room.“Of course.” Martha was glad that she knew the correct answer. “It’s the oldest environmental certificate in the world...”“You are oriented, that’s nice...” said the woman interviewing in a tailor-made jacket and a string of pearls who then seemed to hesitate “but you probably never heard of the Green Angel?”“No.”“Exactly. Because here we have such special certificates. More exclusive.”“Oh” Martha only said. “And what is this certification characterized by?”“It’s the best of them all. The Green Angel means that our products are one hundred per cent ecological and biodegradable.”Marta looked around at the cosmetics standing on the shelves. Their plastic packaging looked just as biodegradable as Soviet tanks. She couldn’t understand how the boutique’s owner could practice such shameless greenwashing. She already knew that not only will she not get this job, but that doesn’t want it.“I understand that you need to give the clients crap, but I don’t understand why you feel compelled to deceive prospective employees?”The interviewing woman snorted, then started coughing nervously. Finally, she only managed to get out:“Yesss, thank you, that is probably all.” and with her gaze showed her the door.Martha for a moment glared at the owner, and then quietly got up and left. She felt strangely happy. Well, she didn’t get a job, but at least she knew that she had behaved properly. It was an extremely pleasant feeling. It was as if she helped fifty old people cross a busy street simultaneously. She no longer wanted to cry. She knew that she is strong and can cope. Everything else will be fine, she thought and started walking, feeling that whatever path she selects it will be good."

			"body":"The farther into the forest, the more the trees - the farther from high school, the less space in the cosmetics bag. With such a philosophical view Julia began her day, looking at the arsenal accumulated in the bathroom. The times when soap and water were enough passed more or less half way through elementary school. A wave of transformation swept the nation, and with her - a wave of pimples. It’s good that no one even dreamed yet about the Internet and cameras in a phone, for at least there is no incriminating evidence. The one advantage of all of this growing up was that it passed as quickly as the fashion for jackets made from crash textile. One needs to confess though, that the following fifteen years flew by quickly. And now Julia is who she is and looks as you can see.Supposedly there is no reason to complain, but a sharp eye - especially Julia’s eye - immediately caught symptoms of disintegration and destruction: a battle was waged on her face day after day, which Julia had to win. The massive wrinkle attacks, treacherous landings of discolorations and blasts of bursting vessels required a continuous arms race.That’s why Julia started each day with an inspection of her ammunition and a counter strategy. On the front lines were sent specialised deep penetration materials - the enemy needed to be awaken and immediately neutralized. Reaching for micellar liquid, Julia in her thoughts counted all her allies listed on the packaging: each ecological certificate was worth as much as the best marine unit. It’s true that checking them required some effort, but it was worth it. Julia had enough of those pretending to be natural, with their alleged “bio” which brought more harm than good. Oh no - do your eco brain washing on another battlefield.After a quick review of the troops Julia reached for the heaviest artillery. Sitting until late last night in the club unfortunately left its traces and now mother nature needs to be called to the rescue. Cream from ecologically grown crops, tonic with natural minerals and soap without parabens - Julia felt as if Captain Planet himself came to the rescue. For a moment she imagined herself as she fights an entire army of bacteria and other filth, while landfills of residual dirt disappear forever in the washbasin.Now a critical look in the mirror - somewhat better, but she still can’t lay down her weapons.  Fortunately, there was still an hour before having to leave for work, many such a war could be won in such time. Applying the foundation, Julia thought about all those who do not share her love for morning clashes and slept carefree, while she fought so fiercely. Her younger colleague for example - recently admitted she just needs a morning shower and at the most mascara. Julia was overcome with horror, as if she saw a ghost or other alien.“What do you mean? What about wrinkles? Isn’t old age approaching in the steps of a sprinter? Girl, in a few years do you really want look like your own grandmother in pictures? Of course technology has advanced and there are various filters or other instagrams, but you can’t deceive yourself. The more that young skin soaks in, the more one saves with plastic surgery.From the good of her heart, Julia brought her friend samples from her own stock pile, but neither threats nor requests achieved anything. Yes, her friend was interested in the shampoo with the bunny symbol, but for a short time and only because she loves animals. For sure, she loves! But her shower gel was tested on half of the African jungle. Don’t those people really think about their future? You are what you eat and what you smear on yourself (another proverb from the series she wrote - good, isn’t it?). After all, these packages of pseudo cosmetics in the shops, in packs of four rather than in one large container and imported from God knows what part of Asia, is one large biological bomb! Radiation, chemistry and conflagration for the environment. And then later people are surprised by falling acid rains and tsunamis that come up on the Baltic. Strike the planet and the rubbish will reply, that’s the truth.Well, Julia won’t force them to be happy. She’ll mind her own business and in a few years they’ll see who was right. Under the condition that they’ll recognize her under tonnes of botoks.Daydreaming about catastrophic visions, Julia forgot for a moment about the ongoing war. Suddenly, however, like the firing of a cannon at Samosierra, the alarm clock reminded her about leaving for work.“Oh no, here I am thinking about acid rains, and in twenty minutes I have my first meeting!” Quickly, the last manoeuvre and time to inspect the fortifications. Powder - present. Lipstick - present. Painted eyelashes - present. Lip liner, blush, concealer and eye liner - at their positions. No signs of old age will get past.Leaving the bathroom, Julia glanced once more for a quick check. Whew. Not so bad for someone who will turn thirty next year. Captain Planet for certain wouldn’t be able to resist her."

			"body":"Nothing in him could make her more upset than not segregating rubbish. Of course he probably had some other flaws. Although none of them came to her mind right now. But ultimately, we all have some. She, for example, doesn’t like animals. From the beginning, admittedly, she didn’t know that it is a flaw. It seemed to her that it was only a neutral trait. Just like any other. Some people like blue, others red, some the sea, others mountains, some Bach, others ukulele. As many tastes as there are people. But soon it became clear that it was not true. The dislike of animals is not an ordinary trait, but a specific flaw and no woman with whom that information was shared, had no doubt about it.     “You don’t like animals?!” they asked more or less scared / disappointed / shocked. At first she shrugged her shoulders, which also turned out to be an inadequate response. In time she simply stopped admitting to this “flaw”.    The segregation of rubbish though, that was a completely different matter. After all, he didn’t do it on purpose, let alone maliciously. He knew, nevertheless, that recyclable stuff needs to be separated from the normal rubbish. What’s more, they had hanged in the kitchen a colour poster prepared by the city, where it is very clear that paper, plastic and metal go to the red; glass to green and the rest to black. It’s really not so hard! And it is impossible that he has not read this leaflet. Although sometimes, when she brought full bags to the rubbish bin, she started to doubt. In any case she repacked everything and segregated again. So that everything would be fine. She even had gloves hidden between the rubbish bins so not to dirty her hands. Each time when she returned, she promised herself that she’ll order him to memorize the leaflet, and then she’ll conduct tests. Of course, all these thoughts passed immediately after returning home. It took just one look at his angelic, innocent face. You don’t give tests to such guys. Such guys we thank that we can be in their presence. Moreover, he also does not ask what I am doing for so long at the rubbish bin. But given that the situation is constantly repeating, perhaps he is beginning to suspect some dark secret.     Once, when she drove him to work one morning, she thought that she’ll trick him. Without looking him in the face - after all, she couldn’t look, because she had to be a vigilant participant in road traffic - she tried to ask a question:    “Damn it” she started, because she didn’t know how to get started, “could you remind me... rubbish... glass we throw to the red...?”    Full of sympathy he burst out laughing, as only he is able to do.    “Don’t tell me...” he began, when he finally stopped laughing. And she felt that his laughter lasts through all eternity. “Well don’t tell me, that you don’t remember?”     “No I’m serious” she tried to explain.    “You know what I thought when I first met you? This is a woman that could be my wife. A person who is able to keep the home fires burning and will never make a mistake with sorting rubbish...”    “You never told me that.”    “Because it’s stupid. To fall in love with a woman who knows how to segregate rubbish? Even I could not think of something that stupid...”     His coyness, the ability to stir emotions by mixing truth and fabrication. She loved this about him very much. Sometimes she wanted to cry when she thought about it. The world, which created such a miraculous being as he, could not be so bad, although he usually had such an official opinion about the world.     She was tormented by the question: Why: if you thought so - since you know that it is important to me - why do you never do it? But she didn’t dare ask him. Besides, was this a matter of courage? After all, would he be hurt by it? Was she afraid that if her boyfriend finds out, that there is something that he does not do perfectly, that he’ll start to suspect that she does not love him completely and irrevocably? She had to be afraid though of something.    When she went to work, she began to think about it. Maybe out of love for him she should drop the topic of segregating rubbish? Eventually people can change. If this is to stand on the path to their love, she should suppress her passion for segregation. If your hand causes you to sin, cut it off, was bouncing around in the back of her head. Probably someone famous said that. Maybe Sting? Or Bono? He often comes out with such preaching texts.     When she returned home a sumptuous dinner was waiting for her. Sometimes he made such surprises for her. She was happy. This time he started the conversation.    “For some time something in our relationship bothers me...”    She was scared of those words. What was coming didn’t look good.    “And I think that is something that I should I tell you.”    She remained silent, but now she was really scared. She knew a lot about him - what socks he likes to wear, the nickname kids gave him in elementary school, she knew all his passwords - and if she didn’t know something, it had to be something in the style of: I’m a robot for American intelligence services; I come from Krypton and they sent me to earth to prepare for a space invasion...    The truth, as always, proved to be much more trivial.    “I’m colour blind, that’s why I have a problem with segregating rubbish. Simply I don’t know which container is which.”    The next day she changed the coloured stickers on the bins for infographics. Unfortunately, it evidently turned out that daltonism was not the cause of his lack of segregation. "

			"body":"There is a quite large group of people who apparently have problems sleeping. When after a day of life’s struggles the night comes. The curtain of awareness falls and they are haunted by their dreams. Dreams, as dreams, show up uninvited. The light goes out and under the lowered eyelids begins the projection. These people usually associate their night visions with uncommon imagination, although their causes should be traced to uncomfortable beds or eating in the evening foods of questionable quality. And there would not be anything wrong with it, if the contents of the night’s phantasmagoria didn’t decide to show up in the environment the next day.In their dreams people have supernatural powers, they are travelling to remote corners of galaxies, they meet strange characters, often demons from the past, or get mixed up in situations in which even philosophers have never dreamed of. Such dreams have not been dreamed of by philosophers, because as a rule dreams are based on a scenario with a defective construction. This is the overwhelming majority of class B horror movies, cheap romance novels and science fiction writers on acid. And in the end... Ha! If there is an end. In the vast majority of cases the tension that is built up in the listeners is brutally interrupted by the standard: “And then I woke up!”. As if someone pulled the plug from the wall socket while watching TV. The master of suspense of a plot without sense.Is this at all in accordance with human rights, that another human being would torture the digestive processes of another’s mind? Expelling the contents of plots that were loosely joined together during the night on a random victim? Because do you care that, for example, last night I dreamed that...Waking up in the morning, with horror I discovered that my profile was missing, actually two – my left and right. I also didn’t have any hands or feet. Nothing. I woke up as a great wrinkle. What would an abnormal size wrinkle remind you of? I’ll leave it to your imagination.I had to look for help. I went therefore to the drugstore in the hope that I can find something that will cause my problem to disappear. In hope that it will disappear, means - I will return to the old human form, not at all that I’ll disappear from the face of the earth. I was greeted by all types of creams standing on the shelves, who seeing my miserable posture, began to flex like bodybuilders during a competition.“Choose me! Take me! Here I am!” they shouted.“What you have to offer?” I asked, thereby causing a flow of words.The lids started to show their interiors, the masks started to show their faces and the tubes started to blow. The words they threw out began to merge into hyaluronicing-micro-macro-lifting-moisturizing-matifying-fast absorbing, with liquid laser formula, with particles, firming gibberish. It is sad to discover that even in a dream my ability to make a binding decision teeters on the border of failure.Suddenly, however, I felt that someone is tapping my shoulder, which after all I don’t have, because I converted into the form of a great wrinkle, but it’s only a dream. I turn around and see a Blue Angel with a Swan under his arm.“Who are you, may I ask?”“I am the Blue Angel and this is Nordic Swan. We are markings of ecological products, which considering your total and undeniable ignorance have decided to leave the package in order to protect you from the manipulation of those products here. Will you allow this Greek chorus to seduce you? Hamartia!”“Get lost, blue dish-rag!” the greasy tribune said with one voice. “Behind us stand large corporations, efficacy studies, safety of use. No one is producing us in a garage.”“Marketing gibberish” snapped the Blue Angel. “Show proof!”Wanting to ignore provocation, the cosmetics, whistling, began turning their back on me, which only made ​​the situation worse, because with a person it is a non-verbal affront, while cream has the truth written about itself in small print. Realizing the situation, the cosmetics turned around violently and in a huge commotion began to knock each other off the shelves.“Yes! Fall, you dubious consistency” the angel shouted. “The only thing that you know how to do is get stuck in toxic compounds. And the only thing that stands behind you are slogans written by paid copywriters.”“I am bio!” one of them said indignantly, banging on its lid.“And I’m natural, eco-friendly!” echoed another one which was rolling around.“This” snorted the angel, “is an empty declaration, here what counts is certification! Aside from being big talkers, are you also tested? You know how much effort is needed for me to envelop a product with my angelic care? Empty verbiage is not enough here! Not all markings are equal! You know what those like me - the Blue Angel, Nordic Swan, Ecocert, Cosmebio, and European Daisy - make the best of the best? It is that we are not everywhere or for everyone! We are a reward for the efforts in meeting the stringent environmental requirements. And you hustlers tested on animals, scented with synthetic fragrances, petro-chemical coloured, in your pretty costumes disinfected during radioactive exposure, do you have within you even a thread of environmentalism? You say that you are bio. Where is your five per cent of all raw materials and at least fifty per cent of raw materials of plant origin from certified ecological crops? You say that you are ecological. Do you have in you ten per cent of all and ninety five per cent of raw materials of plant origin from certified ecological crops?”“You eco-leftist! We’ll still win, for people will believe in any advertising nonsense, in order to, no offense” directed to me, “not look like one big wrinkle. Because you are a wrinkle, aren’t you? Or are you looking for the section with preparations for disease of the...”According to the already mentioned scheme - I then woke up. What do you think? This dream means anything to you? No? It should."

			"body":"They ordered him to cut his hair. His long stands in the eyes of his mother and father made him a rebel. Hair grows, because such is the law of nature, and what miracle of nature could be a sign of rebellion, he argued? Once, during a Sunday dinner, in reply to another comment, he snapped that Jesus also walked around in long hair and it didn’t make a big impression on anyone, and what’s more, grandma daily prays to Him. Then his father slammed his fist on the table so hard that the plates for a moment began to defy the laws of gravity, his mother rolled her eyes almost all the way around, and grandma looked anxiously at the cross hanging above the door.Finally he got a haircut. Not because he felt pressured, but because he wanted to. Together with a new stage in his life came a new passion: ecology. His mother at the beginning was even happy that finally he found himself a hobby. A hobby was her only known method to protect her child against narcotics. However, when he challenged most of the cosmetics standing in the bathroom, she lost her enthusiasm: “I didn’t spend so much money on them to now listen to marketing gimmicks, tormented animals or chemical compounds! Your father is enough for me!”. That evening she mentioned to her concerns to her husband that it may be some cult, and that soon her son will lose interest in reading product labels, which has extending their visits to shops by 15 minutes, and will start chaining himself to trees or with his teeth tear asbestos from roofs in the neighbourhood.Grandma in turn, up till now considered by him to be the most conservative person in the family, actually in his eyes proved to be the most avant-garde. As soon as spring arrived, she disappeared for the entire day, going to the garden plot, only to return with the fruit of the land. Father for a long time postulated that everything needs to be dug up, to set up a barbecue and invite over our neighbours at flat number 7.“What do you need these vegetables for? Today everything is in the supermarkets: better and nicer looking. If you want, I’ll drive you there” he grumbled.“Over my dead body you’ll dig everything up!” denied grandma.“Just so you know! And I’ll bury you there too!”“Start digging!” she threatened like a rebellious teenager. “But under the cherry tree, because I want to be next to Thaddeus.” Thaddeus was grandma’s beloved dog, whom she ordered to be buried next to the tree, so that his spirit would scaring starlings.At the end of the summer the kitchen was transformed into a vegetable and fruit processing plant. In the pantry rows of jars rose to the ceiling. Over subsequent months they disappeared as rows of blocks in Tetris.In addition, grandma never wasted anything. She could find at least one application for almost everything. She was like Bear Grylls in an apron with flowers. Empty yogurt cups became flower pots, food scraps fertilizer, she even took out dead hair from brushes:“For wild boars” she informed dumbfounded observers, “so that boars will stay out of the garden. They are scared of this like the devil with holy water. Yours in particular, Mary.”When grandma had to go throw out the rubbish, it did not represent a problem for her, for always when she divided it up between the individual containers she could find out what’s new on the block. With her friends she even created a neighbourhood squadron. The older ladies set their gunsights on those who have fallen to a new variety of colour blindness, which does not allow them to distinguish the yellow from the green container. As part of wide-range actions they sent offenders hateful looks glances and threaten them with empty buckets.For years she wore the same clothes, and yet always looked elegant. If a hole appeared - she mended it. She seemed to be the last ray of hope that Huxley was wrong.All her life grandma repeated the word “once” like a mantra. Once there was, once it used to be. This “once” was a synonym for what is better. Once this “once” made her grandson nausea. At some point he concluded that once we were all ecologists, but we mishandled what we had, because we were already eco, but then this scoundrel moved into our homes - consumerism."

As if I gradually it fell into pieces.“What are you talking about, Tommy? What nonsense is going around in your head?” said the friend sitting in the corner.“I can’t help it. Simply that’s the way I feel. Tough luck. It looks like when they distributed parts, I was standing in the wrong queue. The hands aren’t what they were. I’m barely standing on my feet. Completely as if I was produced in a worse factory than the rest. And once? Do you even remember?”“I remember, dear Tommy, I remember.”“I was a star.”“No...  you were not Tommy, but because you have a moment of weakness, I am willing to admit you are right for the sake of our long-standing friendship.”“Wally? Do you remember those parties from the morning? The day mingled with the night. The entire city was fast asleep and we were in high gear. Tell me, Wally, but be honest, do you always have to be so sad?”“I don’t know, Tommy, I don’t know. Maybe it’s true that the more colourful the life, the blacker the end? Because if that is the case, my end will be rather faded.”“Wally! Don’t joke when I am serious.”“But I’m not joking, dear friend, because when you led the high life, I was, so to speak, in the same bed.”“Because you are such a teddy bear” suddenly said the female voice, “in fact I could say: a real teddy bear.”“Ah! Zofia! Is that you?” Thomas livened up.“Yes, my friends, it’s me.”“You are now... in a wheelchair?” Wally noted with sadness. “How are you coping?”“I’m not complaining!” Zofia replied briskly. “Now I’m pushed around. Dressed, feed. “I’ll tell you my friends: I’m like a child now.”“I envy you” reflected Thomas, without much conviction in his voice. This was met with mockery from his companion.“Zofia our dear, let me tell you what we’ve been talking about. Today our colleague is in a bad mood. He feels the end. He sees big paramedics and a plastic bag.”“If they would at least put me” Thomas continued his wailing, “somewhere in my old age. In a home, some facility. Maybe I could still be useful for someone? After all, it can’t be that suddenly one day we become useless! One day you’re here, the next day you’re not. Ah, Wilma! “Why am I not rooted!”“You cannot lose hope!” comforted Zofia, but Wally, instead of making an alliance with her against the depression of an old friend, began to pull bodies out of the closet:“Do you remember her? What was she? CE? CE? CEcylia? CElina? Yes! Celina. Miss CE!”This memory made ​​caused Thomas’ friends to see on his face for a split second a grimace of a smile, or maybe it was only a hallucination?“Miss CE” he repeated dreamily after his companion. “The CE was her trademark. Wonderful! With an explosion of blond hair.”Zofia did not appear to embrace their youthful enthusiasm awakened for a moment:“Bah! Ah!” she waved her hand. “The star of one season! One of those, who at the first meeting looks like Miss America, and then it turns out is from regular plastic. Everything from plastic. Tits from plastic. Most likely legs and hair also. Simply Barbie. I would call into question the features Miss CE gave. Are the letters, if my colleagues know what I have in mind, equally spaced, or are they not sometimes to close to each other? Is their shape correct, because CE may be a manipulation. Better to always check. Anyway, my colleagues, it’s now B! Well, B is more in the price.”And although these words caused quite a chuckle, it didn’t knock her off balance:“B is today’s CE. I see that you are surprised, but to my knowledge this is the case. Now everyone looks if it is B... At least they should.”“I like it” sounded the voice not heard for a long time in this group.“Ho! ho! Who came back from a distant journey? We thought that while our trio was talking, that you were sleeping.”“No, my friends. Not only have I not been sleeping, I’ve been listening to you for a long time and I can’t agree with Zofia. Miss CE was quite a doll! Personally I always had the opinion that we fit each other. And if fate gave us a chance to be in each other’s company longer, then...”But his reasoning was broken by the laughter.“I think I’ll die sooner than I thought” Thomas gasped his last strength, “from laughter! You and miss CE? You with that wooden leg of yours?”“Go ahead and laugh!” one of the friends waved with his wooden leg. “And the FSC? Oh! Or maybe you heard about the PEFC society? Meaning that wood from which wooden parts are produced, may come from ecological crops? I’m telling you, this wooden element makes me the most unique among you, because when in fact the end comes, my history dustbin will turn out to be more noble than yours.”The faces of laughter gathered there suddenly changed to doubt.“And supposedly why is that so?” as they looked at each other.“Quiet!” Zofia suddenly jumped.“What?”“Do you hear that?” her voice trailed off. “She’s coming!”Suddenly the door opened and a girl entered the room. All the toys became quite as enchanted. The girl stroked Zofia lying in the wheelchair. She placed under her arm Wally the teddy bear and jumped under her covers. She didn’t even glance at Tommy the solider standing on the wardrobe. Despite the initial excitement it proved to be an exceptionally misguided gift, one of many."

			"body":"Apparently, everyone on earth is distanced from another one by seven handshakes. It means that through seven people who know each other, one is able to reach from a Chinese farmer to the President of the United States. That is if someone wanted to cover this distance. Probably not so many people would want that, given the fact that not all farmers are friends with the president. Here, of course, another popular theory comes in handy. Well, a person may know in life up to three hundred people. Simply a person is physically unable to have more friends. Obviously, this is just a stupid psychological theory that is not supported by facts. However, if we assume that both of these theories are true, we will understand that there is nothing surprising in the fact that Chinese farmers are not friends with presidents. They just know too many people and no longer have a place for each other in their hearts with limited capacity.Emil never agreed with any of these theories. His heart was big and full of love. He felt that he could know everyone. And everyone is more than seven or even three hundred people. And even if he was to meet three hundred people in order to finally meet with the president, he was willing to do that. After all, he had nothing else to do. During the day he was going to school trying hard not to draw anyone’s attention. In the afternoons he played games, because the chance that someone will pay attention to him in his own house practically did not exist. When he wasn’t occupied with one thing or the other, he wondered who had previously worn his t-shirts.He would imagine, for example, that one of his shirts was worn by the U.S. President Barack Obama. He was not sure which one exactly, but sometimes he thought he could smell him. On that occasion, he even studied a little bit of United States geography, and especially Hawaii, where the president grew up. He even bought for the occasion a few Hawaiian shirts. The question is, however, do people in Hawaii actually wear Hawaiian shirts? He only bought t-shirts in second-hand shops. Not because they were cheaper, but for a very simple reason. It dramatically reduced the chance that someone else in the school will be wearing something similar. This was his biggest fear. Sometimes he would wake up drenched in sweat in the middle of the night; because in his dream it turned out that he was wearing the same clothes as his classmate, whom he met on his way to school. Sometimes the dream was longer and Emil would wake up at the moment he entered the classroom and saw that all the students in the room have the same t-shirt as he and they were all laughing at him. Why would they laugh if he looked the same as everyone else? - he wondered after waking up, but so far he did not come to any conclusions. In any case he tried to avoid such situation.Besides, Emil liked used t-shirts. He didn’t buy new ones for several reasons. First, sixty Polish zloty for a cotton t-shirt smelled of transferring money to the bank accounts of those who already had a lot of money. Second, twenty Polish zloty for a cotton t-shirt involved the exploitation of child labour in Bangladesh or Burma. Thirdly, the world is already full of many things and one should not contribute to the emergence new things.Days and weeks passed. Emil had a collection of t-shirts big enough to open a small museum. He had limited edition t-shirts designed by members of Iron Maiden, handmade shirts of bands that were never heard about on English-speaking Internet and a strange t-shirt from Boar’s Tavern in Honolulu, where a TV throwing competition was organised. It gave him great confidence that no one has similar t-shirts. But he could never be sure, so Emil always had a spare t-shirt in his rucksack. Just in case someone was dressed the same as he was. He also wore tight-fitting black trousers. He had no problems with trousers. Everyone could have the same and he wouldn’t even notice. The t-shirt was a determinant of his identity.When Emil found out that the American president was to visit Poland during the upcoming climate summit, he immediately began to convince his parents to go to the capital. Surprisingly, his parents did not have much against it. Probably they were even happy that their son displays civil commitment. After all, everybody knows what the youth are like today. For them, politics is worse than polyamory. They believe more in voting in online surveys than dropping a paper in a ballot box.Finally the time came for the whole family to take the trip from Bytom to the capital city. Train tickets were bought in advance, while relatives in Warsaw were informed about the circumstances and prepared for the overnight guests. Obama was to place wreaths on the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier and at the Monument to the Ghetto Heroes. There was hope that in one of these places the President could be seen up close.They took a place near the entrance, but it required a lot of persistence and plotting. But at least they were sure that they will see the president. Emil never suspected in his wildest dreams that Obama seeing his t-shirt will stop and ask:“Hey, man, where did you get that shirt from?” And then comes closer and adds: “It’s a t-shirt of the baseball team from my high school. I haven’t seen it for years, I think they stopped making them a long time ago.” and shaked Emil’s hand. “Amazing, people in Poland never waste anything!”A day later all the tabloids repeated these words. “Obama praises the Poles!” was written on the pages of the most frequently read papers. Although a less widely read daily thundered: “Barack takes us for beggars!”. Most commentators, however, stood on the side of Emil: ecology, sustainable development, agrotourism - the future of Poland.Emil even gave an interview on a popular internet portal where he explained his approach to clothes from second-hand shops and told the story of finding Obama’s high school baseball team t-shirt. His colleagues from high school were jealous, which also had a negative side to it, as they started to pay attention to him. With time, it turned out that he actually likes it. Well. Perhaps it is true that people are distanced from each other by seven handshakes. But sometimes you need only one."

			"body":"“Don’t think of this as a normal second-hand” she said, when we rode by tram to the outskirts of the city.We already passed perhaps thirty stops. I had the feeling that we got stuck in a time loop and that this line has no end.“I never have bought anything in a second-hand” I replied.She didn’t comment.On the tram there was no longer anyone except an older guy sleeping and young hoodie, nervously tapping his foot to whatever melody was coming from his phone. I had never been in this district - with a landscape that looked like an atomic bomb had exploded, emerged gray, rectangular buildings. In each of them was located some company, in ninety per cent of the cases they were warehouses with the mandatory “pol” at the end of the name, indicating that it is a Polish company“Listen, couldn’t we go straight to the park?” I asked. “It’s Saturday.”There was no response. Her eyes glittered as a little child fifteen minutes before going to Legoland.At last the tram stopped with a piercing squeal. We got out at the stop. No matter how you look at, it was the end of the city, the city where I was born and raised, and here - I swear - I was for the first time in my life.“So we rode through the whole city, to rummage through a pile of worn clothing” I moaned, and she led me through a maze of narrow streets, covered with uneven sidewalks, overgrown by weeds and grass clumps. I felt like I went on a trip to the Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic or some other, strange country, where there’s no cash machines, mobile phone networks, consular assistance and wider civilization.“Just think how many people are sitting now in shopping centres” she said.“I have never in my life spent a Saturday at a shopping centre” I assured and after a moment added: “At least in a shopping centre you could buy something cold to drink and eat some fast food.”“You’ll never eat fast food again” she replied.We had been dating for three months. She was a vegan, practicing yoga and reading a strange book about how allegedly dolphins are more intelligent than people. Her hands were tattooed with all the colours of the rainbow and she studied screenwriting. Maybe I made fun of her, maybe it all seemed childish to me, if I had not fallen in love with her ​​like a moron.“I only buy clothes here” she said, when at last we stood in front of this strange, gray, two storey building, on which someone painted on the window the inscription: USED ​​CLOTHING.“You never buy new?” I asked.She shook her head. We went inside.The first thing that I noticed was a lady around fifty years old sitting behind a table, which was also a sort of cash desk. She had in herself the tranquillity of a Buddhist monk. Not paying any attention to us, she solved her crossword puzzle. In addition to the woman, her crossword puzzle and the table in the middle were clothes. Tonnes, cubic kilometres, immeasurable amount of clothes. Hung on hangers, stacked in piles, overflowing the huge baskets. The smell of disinfectant was everywhere.Here I should mention that my attitude to clothes is somewhat ambivalent. Fashion has always seemed to me to be the most superfluous spheres of human activity. I try to dress drab, with things that are currently in the shops. I never belonged to any subculture. All my life I had a quiet conviction that in the matter of dress I must be a person who blends in. I knew, however, for that everyone who pays more attention to this topic than I, for each of them this place was a sort of hidden treasury. Ali Baba’s cave.“Come” she said and dragged me into this world that was completely foreign to me.When she had tried on thirty second pairs of trousers, I was really tired. Lying next to the changing rooms were bags bulging with slippers, shoes, shorts, jackets, leggings, blouses, some plastic toy from the eighties, which was supposed to be Batman and caps. A separate bag was meant for me. She didn’t even ask for my opinion, she simply held things up to me and threw them in the bag. A hooded sweatshirt with a drawing of strange monkeys. A t-shirt with taut and ready to punch Sylvester Stallone. Practically new Diesel jeans.“And if I do not want to wear this?” I expressed my doubt.“These are gifts” she insisted, trying on a viciously red waistcoat.I nodded.After three hours I was hungry. I didn’t want to tell her. She wouldn’t understand anyways. I had the feeling that she’s in something like a religious trance. She could spend a few days here without eating and drinking.“Have you ever thought about creating a fashion blog?” I asked.“Have you ever thought about changing your jokes?” she retorted.The more she badgered me, the more I was in love with her. But that is probably normal.After another hour, stuffing Donny Karan tube trousers in the bag, she said:“I think that’s all”.“I’m about to die of hunger” I complained.“You whine more than my grandmother” she huffed.I felt like a hero from gulag literature. The sugar level in my body fell at the rate of a broken elevator. I was starting to feel dizzy. Well, I am a typical guy. I have to eat a few meals a day. When we arrived at the checkout, the women without a word closed her crossword puzzle and began to weigh the bags on an electronic scale. When she finished, with an absolutely indifferent expression said:“Three hundred and ten zloty”.When we left, I expressed my astonishment.“That’s as much as one pair of trousers in...”“In anywhere” she finished. “I can’t believe that you never bought anything in a second hand.”“Somehow I couldn’t deal with the fact that someone wore something before me” I said, walking slowly down the sidewalk, feeling a cosmic vacuum in my stomach.“It’s a good thing that someone else wore them” she emphasized. “There are too many clothes in the world.”“Today I saw this” I said and added: “Let’s call a taxi, I beg you.”She took out of the bag the t-shirt with Rocky. It was quite funny. I held it up in front of me.“For certain you’re not going to wear it?” she asked.“I was only teasing” I replied.That t-shirt was really nice. I took all the bags - in total they weighed a good fifteen kilo. She took the phone out of her purse and called a taxi. Waiting for someone on the other end to pick up the phone, she turned to me and said:“Really in a moment we’ll have something to eat. And I guarantee you that it will be very good and making it will take only fifteen minutes.”In the depths of my spirit I breathed a sigh of relief. I was madly in love with her."

I am a resident of a big city, followed by these cemetery hyenas from the landfill.When I’m walking down the street I hear them in the sky screaming insults at me and then showing me their beaks. “He!he!he!he!he!he!” I have the impression that they are banding together and soon will begin to dive like fighter jets. Straight to the target. And the target is “He!he!he!he!he!he!”. Yes. He is me. And here is my confession as a gadgetman.Not that I am overly sensitive, but I don’t like to be present when a battery dies. Simply it’s not my style. Me - I have a new phone every year, two at the most. I love the moment. You take the box from the bag. You open the box and you can now see the little guy, who is still sleeping in the film. You gentle reach for him. You unpack him. You peel back the screen protection. It is the best, you acknowledge with satisfaction and you notice with genuine appreciation that even chargers have better designs.You compare the new trophy with the old phone. Compared to the new, the old always seems like it’s from the Stone Age. And that moment when you can feed your ego - the moment, when your new acquisition is reflected in the eyes of others.She happened to be on that day. The girl from the coffee shop where I go everyday for coffee in a take-out cup. I was standing behind the counter, waiting for my order, when the phone rang. It buzzed, so I took it out. You never know. Maybe today something important will happen.“New?” she asks. Looking like a conjurer I turn the shinny trinket in the palm of my hand.“Yeah, a month ago” I casually reply.“And the old?” she inquires.“The old? The old, my dear, has been already lying in the landfill for some time now and is thriving!” I answered dashingly.But my “hilarious” reply worked on her like a spell, and that nice angel face who daily gave me coffee changed into the face of a murderer.“Electro rubbish” she hisses through her teeth.“Ah... what? That me?! That electro?... What did you say?”“Electro rubbish!”“You can talk to me like that?” I asked, trying to get to the surface from the shock I just suffered.“The telephone!…Not you! Your telephone! The telephone is electro rubbish! Although...”Who a moment ago would have thought that this morning I would be awakened not by caffeine, but by the lecture just beginning, from which not only the coffee became cold.It turned that I was deprived of eco conscience. Because of this the poor seagulls levitating over the garbage heaps in search of food can at most have a cocktail of mercury.To make things worse! Horror! Since there are a lot more creeps like me, who without thinking throw no matter what, no matter where. What a fine mess is made for the waitress, the woman in the queue behind me, for the man behind that woman and for that dog that is standing with the man. For everyone! The people in the cafe, district, town, country and also places out of sight. THANKS A LOT!! Yahoo! Drum roll and fireworks in the sky!Yes! Those innocent, small, flat, thin phones, and in their footsteps computers (what did I do with my old laptop?), TVs (I didn’t like my plasma so much anymore), printers, DVD players, refrigerators, light bulbs, batteries, and other stuff on the endless list of electro rubbish release to the soil and groundwater the entire Mendeleev’s table.Just a moment, they get revenge on their former, soulless owners with an entire palette of cancer and brain disorders.“What do you need this phone for” she asks, “since soon you will have sight, hearing and speech problems? Why do you need that sleek touch screen, if motor coordination disorders await you?!Don’t you have there any app that would allow you to realize how important is correct rubbish segregation, including electro rubbish? Probably not! Because if something is thriving it’s not your old phone in the landfill, but your stupidity. That will be eleven twenty for the coffee. Anything else?”I thanked her for the coffee. Who knows what is floating in it. I walked out, pushing the phone deep into my pocket.Last week a seagull sat on my balcony railing. To chase away my “angel of death”, I grabbed the first thing that I had on hand - a plastic bottle crusher. Yes. I discovered a new, conscience outlet for my gadgety nature."

			"body":"I’m joining the Higher School of Etiquette! This is not an empty declaration. It’s a fact. I’m joining, because decency in the nation is perishing, and it’s never too late for repentance and learning. And I’m not the only adept. How can you recognize us?The main characteristic is practicing the art of careful study. In silence we weave between the isles. We scan the shelves, and when we see an interesting item, we don’t let emotions carry us away. We carefully roll it in our hands and read, proving that reading is not a lost art in Poland. We are very vigilant, because we know that what at first glance may look like poetry, hiding under the beautiful wrapper there may be hiding first class rubbish, which consumption satisfies the hunger, but does not carry any valuable content. At the most, its remains, with a bit of luck, will end up in the appropriate container for rubbish. Because food, like books, is not judged by the cover. You need to venture deeper. Yes! Food! Because our environment is not the library - I’m taking you on a shopping trip to the supermarket of informed consumers.Healthy, natural, low-fat! Straight from orchard and free range! Ripened in the sun, light and extra - assured to us by producers. Smiling cows, grazing on mythical green meadows, look at us from their packaging with eyelashes as big as fans. Attractive figures smile at us with snow white teeth, as if they’ve know us for years. Firm fruits tempt with their ideal shape and seduce with their saturated colours. But what really hides behind the promise of consumer paradise? The label, fool!Instead of idyllic images, search for the so-called euroleaf, which means that the food you reach for has been produced and processed in accordance with the principles of ecological farming. By selecting such product, you get twice the benefits, because ecological crops are good not only for your body, but also for the environment, in which your body exists.An adept from the Higher School of Etiquette is also no stranger to tracing his finger on a map. What does geography have in common with the conscious consumption of food? A simple example: does a country that is the largest producer of apples in Europe, need to export them from Chile, Zimbabwe and New Zealand? How painful is their journey for the environment to travel the great water to our homeland, where apple trees are in abundance? And it’s not at all about it forbidding someone from making such a trip only for it to be devoured. Tonnes of fuels used for the transport of food, and sometimes a chemical jacket, in which highly perishable products are coated, that in all their glory could appear on shop shelves, only to benefit their importers. Certainly not on planet Earth and certainly not for its inhabitants.Therefore, so that you, my dear inhabitants, the third planet from the sun, do not become the victims of our own stupidity and ignorance, I’ll reveal to you the ten commandments of our ecological savoir-vivre. A little bon ton! Wishing you bon appétit!Listen now, and if you understand the fundamental matters that we promoting - repeat after me.First: I EAT AND I DO NOT WASTE. Why do you buy more, if you’re not able to consume it? Does the food corpses and funerals that you regularly conduct bring you joy?Second: HOW IS IT REALLY PREPARED? Be interested in its production method.Third: HUNT FOR THINGS THAT ARE THE LEAST PROCESSED. The longer the path to produce a product, the greater the burden on the environment.Fourth: I CHOOSE THE PACKAGING, NOT - REPACKAGED. Product packaging after eating becomes waste, and often only acts as marketing.Fifth: I AM A MASTER OF HIDE AND SEEK. Properly stored food will be fit longer for human consumption, and you won’t be wasting food.Sixth: TAKE AWAY, PLEASE! If you don’t eat everything in a restaurant, take the rest with you. Food does not land in the rubbish, and when hunger hits you in a few hours, you’ll feast because of your cunning.Seventh: I PLAY THE COLOURS, i.e. I correctly recycle at home. Remember, the white container is for plastic, right?... Of course... it is not! I’m only checking if you are still paying attention.Eighth: I THINK GLOBALLY - I BUY LOCALLY. Buy domestic products, because they don’t have to travel half the globe to get to you.Ninth: I AM WHAT I EAT! Here a comment seems unnecessary. Instead you can recall what passed through your oesophagus today behind the gate of your clenched teeth.And at last the tenth! FIRST I READ, THEN I BUY. A little label reading doesn’t hurt anyone..."

			"body":"I remember when she first came to me, to my house. This was a revolution in my life, a change for the better. However, rarely do changes for the better come without stress.“Calm down” I said.“No, this is terrible” she said, staring into my rubbish bin with such a look on her face, as if she found there radioactive waste.“Listen, this is not heroine or toxic steroids” I tried to tell her anything, but the repulsion on her face scared me more and more. “These are just hamburgers. And fried chicken.”She did not respond.“And pizza” I added.“No, no, no.” She shook her hear. Then she slammed the door to the bin so hard, as if its slamming would send the cursed content somewhere far away, in a completely different time warp.She sat at the kitchen table. For a moment she leaned on it, but after a moment removed her hands with clear disgust.“I didn’t eat this at this table.” I spread my hands widely in a gesture of apology. “As a rule I eat at my desk.”“Oh my gosh” she sighed.I think I already told you that she has the colours of the rainbow tattooed on her hands, was a practicing vegan and student of yoga, and there was a time when she would go to the countryside with a group of friends with similar interests to personally free dogs that were chained up.I sat in front of her. This was a strange feeling, when all of your work, many hours of efforts in a fraction of a second turns out to be completely irrelevant, and what’s more, they turn against you. I cleaned the flat four hours before she arrived. All the clothing strewn across the floor I stuffed into a commode, I cleaned and vacuumed the floors, I did a tonne of laundry and I was only a step away from scouring the grout between the tiles with a tooth brush. Oh, and these packages with food, stacking up at my desk in paper heaps. Most of them I carried to the rubbish bin outside the flat. What remained I readily stuffed in the rubbish bin.They could of well as laid here, strewn all across the floor together with forty kilograms compost, I thought, looking at her. I’m a loser.“Listen” she said after a moment, “it is not a great tragedy.” But think for a moment, that you are what you eat.”“Meaning?” I asked.It sounded like a threatening introduction to a very heavy lecture, in which could be infiltrated by such terms as the harmonious coexistence of all creatures in the universe of nature or spiritual empathy with our furry brothers. Instead, she arose, opened the rubbish bin and took out a box, holding it with two fingers, as if it were a dirty sock.“Do you know how much chemistry is in this?” she asked. “Here is the entire Mendeleev’s table. Do you have any idea how many horrible things must happen, so that you can eat this hamburger?”In silence I waited for the rest. Oh well, you can have a worse mania than this.“Assuming that you eat one, to get your fill” she added after a moment.“Well, two to three” I lied.She tossed the package back to the bin.“Listen, don’t look at me like I murdered your family” I finally gasped.She came over and rubbed my head. I must admit, that it loosened the atmosphere some. However, I still felt like Krystyna Janda in the film Interrogation.“Listen, it is no longer about the whole ecological talk, the planet, animal welfare and so on” she said. “I know that not many people take it to heart, because people primarily think about themselves. But my point is that you think about yourself.”“I think about myself” I declared in accordance with truth.“I don’t want to be with a guy who before his fortieth has already had a heart attack” she said.“Don’t exaggerate...”“Listen, when was the last time you went to the market for fresh vegetables? It’s only a few streets away. A ten minute walk.”I shook my head.“When was the last time you bought something that was grown near you, that didn’t have to be killed in China, processed in Austria, trucked to Poland and here fried in fat, which remembers the times when the Wheel of Fortune was a hit on TV?”“Well, ok, I understand.” I decided to play the classic male idiot. “From now on I will eat healthy.”She went back to the table and sat down. Anger and disgust had already left her face. She looked rather troubled and worried. I poured her wine. I knew that at least this is one thing I have in this house that is vegan and without preservatives. She took a sip.“I am not some fascist” she said, “and it’s not like if you eat fast foods and all that  processed crap, I’ll break up with you. But you have to eat fresh things. Grown locally, as far as possible. You need to know what you eat, because if you were to read what they are putting in the food, you’d grow pale.”“Phew” I let out.It’s hard to admit she’s right. When buying things at the shop - and my purchases usually consisted of frozen food, candy bars and cans - the only thing I checked was the expiration date. I had no idea what I absorbed. I was so sloppy with food that practically the only valuable meal I ate was at pubs. Because lunches at work, which consisted of fat, sugar, salt and fried stuff in various proportions would be difficult to consider healthy.In a certain sense, she was sent to me from heaven. But I knew that before I arrive at that healthy food heaven, I’ll have to crawl through a small hell of chastisements and humiliation.And at this point something happened, which did not have the right to occur. Something that I feared the most. No, I prayed in my mind, I beg you, no. I swallowed with fear. There was a stone at the bottom of my throat. She did it. In slow motion like a climactic scene from a western she approached my fridge.Inside was the protein supplement with which I finished my bodybuilder career, a collection of various soda cans, unopened chilli sauce that has been laying there the past decade, candy bars and cakes, and four different kinds of expired mustard. It could of been worse. For example, I didn’t have there an envelope with anthrax.“Ok, listen” she said, closing the door after a few good minutes of viewing the image of poverty and despair. “Let’s go shopping.”“You’re making dinner?” I asked, slightly unconscious from the stress.“No, you’re making dinner” she said, and then went to the hall to put on her shoes.“Me?” I cried after her. “I don’t even know how to make instant Chinese soup that well.”“I know.” She nodded.“So I’m to make dinner?”“I’ll give you a crash cooking course” she said, and seeing the look on my face added. “Be happy that it will be for free. For such a course you’d cough up quite a nice sum. Don’t be afraid, we’ll start from the simple things. Tomato sauce, soup and other such things.I stood and obediently, like a robot, put on my shoes. Honestly speaking, I really thought it would be worse. I thought that she’d break up with me, and after returning home go through a rigorous disinfection. I thought she’d fall into hysteria. I thought that... oh, never mind.“You know what” I said, opening the door “I don’t even know if I can cut well.She only looked at me and shook her head.“You are absolutely hopeless” she smiled, “but we’ll try to fix that.”"

			"body":"In the morning she came from the shop with shopping, carrying one small bag. Some groats, vegetables, stuff like that.“That’s it? Is it enough?” I asked, removing the package of groats, four tomatoes, a can of beans, vegetarian stock cubes and a half loaf of bread.“Enough” she replied with absolute certainty.I always leave the shop loaded with so much grub as if tomorrow a nuclear bomb was to explode.“We’ll have to go to the shop tomorrow” I said, while she vigorously peeled the vegetables, sitting on a stool.“Then we’ll go” she said with a shrug.When she prepared all the vegetables, she put them in a pot, dried her hands and looked around the flat for a moment. I didn’t know whether she was looking for something, or simply intensely thinking about something.“Let’s go to Star City” she proposed after a moment.“So something is missing.” I momentarily felt triumph.“Let’s go, let’s go” she repeated and not waiting for me, began to put on her shoes, and then added: “An experiment.”So we went.I always receive an anxiety attack about fifteen minutes after entering a supermarket. Not that I began to shake, scream and act like someone possessed. But after fifteen minutes of walking around in pale, hospital lighting, among endless shelves, sagging from all possible known goods, knowing that in the search for the most basic and necessary things I will have to wander here as in the suburbs of Mumbai, I started to feel some anxiety. Shopping centres are an extremely unpleasant and unnatural place, always evoking in me anti-utopian science fiction films. Shopping is generally something that physically tires me - I always have the need that it would last as short as possible, and I cannot understand people who celebrate it and can spend all day viewing and selecting under light the right eggplant or a jar of Indian mustard.“Why did we come here, anyways?” I asked.“An experiment” she repeated.“Everything is at the house.” I made clear to her that we are wasting time here.“An experiment” she repeated, as if we were playing a game.“After all, you don’t like shopping in such places” I said exasperated.She once again smiled and for the fourth time repeated the word “experiment”, as if each time she said that word someone paid her ten zloty.We walked to the shelves with vegetables, squeezing through dozens of maundering people who gave the impression as if in this sanctuary sedatives were sprayed into the air. We stood before sparkling colourful rows of plump tomatoes, peppers, zucchini and lemons. In supermarket light they gave the impression as if they were from plastic.“What’s the matter? That there is GMO?” I guessed.“No, not GMO.” She shook her head. “Come on.”The same amount of time we spent in the dairy isle, looking at containers of yogurt, cheeses, kefirs, buttermilks and just about anything can be obtained from milk on an industrial scale.“Are you looking for vegan?” I asked.“No, we have a full fridge” she replied.I wanted to ask for the fifth time why the hell we came here. But if someone asks a question four times and still did not receive a response, asking it again rather does not make sense. The error lies in the question.“Are we going to buy something?” I looked at the empty cart.“No, we can now go.”I don’t know whether I was more surprised, tired or irritated.We dropped off the empty cart and I’m sure that the security guard looked at us strangely. We walked down the hallway to the exit and crossed the parking lot.“Here’s the car” I reminded her, pointing with my finger, but she kept walking to only she knew where. Obediently I shuffled behind her, because what else could I do. A woman possessed with a vision is an unstoppable element.We circled the supermarket, which took us a good ten minutes. At last we stood before several huge plastic rubbish bins, next to which were stacked pallets and cardboard packaging.“It might not burn” she said, carefully surveying the containers, “but it would be quite unfortunate.”“Is what you want to do in some sense related to terrorism?” I asked. “Because if so, I’d very much like for us to at least talk about it for a moment.”She went to the first container and opened it. She stared for a moment at the content which I couldn’t see. She turned around, smiling, and signalled me to walk over.I looked into the container. Strangely - it did not smell. Secondly, the inside of the container strangely reminded me of the shelves in the supermarket. In the cardboard boxes laid coloured rows of peppers, zucchini, avocado and tomatoes. In the natural light of day they looked even better. Less artificial.“Do you see?” she asked.I nodded.She opened the second container. At the very top laid a pallet of yogurts.“They’re expired” I stated.She picked one up and looked at the lid.“The expiration date is in three days” she said.She took from her pocket a bag and began to fill it with vegetables from the rubbish.“What the heck are you doing?” I said with surprise.“I’m taking vegetables for dinner” she told him, unmoved. “You were right that something was missing.”“I’m to eat from the rubbish?” I couldn’t believe how very exotic was the interest of my life partner. Oh well, I was insanely in love with her.When the bag was filled with vegetables, she slammed the container cover and started for the car.“See how much food we waste” she said. “Not just the two of us. How much we all waste.”“This was the experiment?” I asked.She nodded. We got to the car and she tossed the “shopping” on the rear seat.“These are fresh vegetables. Just wash them with hot water. In the evening they would have landed in the rubbish dump. This is a whole pot of Lecsó. It would have landed in the rubbish. Do you understand?”I nodded. I understood. I sat behind the steering wheel and she took the passenger’s seat. She put on a CD with Latin American music. I looked at her, and she leaned towards me and kissed me on the cheek.“You’ll wash it very thoroughly?” I looked again in her direction.“In this container there was nothing rotten or spoiled. They threw all this away this morning, before the stop opened” she said.“My girlfriend rummages in rubbish bins.” I turned my head, entering traffic.“My boyfriend slowly ceases to live as on a rubbish heap” she replied and scratched my head.I looked again towards the vegetables. They looked good, healthy and real. I rubbed her arm.“If you say so” I said, “than it is probably so.”"

			"body":"“It will become waste / it’s an integral step / in the life cycle of almost every / prooooduuuct” screamed from the small stage of the claustrophobic club Arthur, the vocalist of the punk band Sons of Monkeys, shouting the next words with the fury of a pneumatic hammer crushing concrete.“Prooooduuuct” echoed his enthusiastic audience.“Prooooduuuct, which sooner / or later / will be withdrawn from uuuuuse” continued the singer.This was not their first performance in Grudziądz, but probably the first in which such a numerous audience attended electrified by their performance. The Sons of Monkeys were not always a successful band. In their not so long history they had played at weddings, and even entertained at corporate integration trips for telemarketers from the vindication department. When one of the mobile telephone operators decided to prove that a pickle jar is biodegradable, and specifically decided to eat it, with the universal delight of his colleagues, the band decided to evacuate. A pendrive was left to fulfil the role of a DJ. Probably no one even noticed the difference.But everything changed after appearing on the TV show Everyone Can Sing, where they presented the pro-ecology song called Waste, arranged for a banjo and ukulele. The song quickly became a hit on national radio stations, which usually are reluctant to play Polish music.   The ecological message resounded in village clubs and summer festivals. Maybe the popularity of the song was influenced by the fact that it was during the period of introducing the controversial rubbish law. Waste was on everyone’s lips.Arthur managed to get off the stage, but squealing girl fans who were grabbing his hands, as well as other parts of the body, made it difficult for him. Somehow though he slipped backstage, followed by the rest of the band. A problem occurred though when it turned out that in order to use the toilet, you have to go through the main club hall. The crowd thinned out a bit, and the emotions cooled down, but Arthur didn’t yet close the door to the bathroom when he was stopped by a small blonde. She looked modest, but Arthur knew that he couldn’t escape her. And any begging or excuses that he must go to the toilet won’t help.“So what can we do as buyers of products?” the girl asked slyly, referring to the words of their most famous song.“Oh”, Arthur did not feel so comfortable in the role of an authority, but he couldn’t refuse giving her an answer, “we can be aware of...” he began and leaned against the wall. Only now he realized how very tired he is.“Yes?”“We can be aware that by selecting a new product, we should be guided by not only its content and price, but also the packaging.”“Don’t you feel sometimes a product?” the brilliant blonde asked disturbingly.Arthur didn’t reply. He only slightly tilted his head, trying to get a better look at her.“Don’t you feel sometimes a product?” she repeated the question, though his elementary school teacher told them not once or twice that a given question repeated twice is a sign of mild intellectual impairment.“That’s what I’m asking” reiterated the girl, who apparently never heard such words of wisdom.“Maybe I feel. But you know...”“I don’t know” she replied, and he thought that they always do this. They say that they don’t know, although they know.“Well, we’ll use a product for a shorter or longer period, depending on its nature, however, the first thing we have after we unpack it is waste.”“Are you talking about yourself or about other products?” The girl was far too resolute.“Do you think that I am extraordinary?” Arthur decided to cleverly change the subject.“I think that we are all simultaneously ordinary and extraordinary. We all produce waste. The question is, what do we do with it later?”“That’s right. We should pay attention to the packaging. Sometimes we want to sell something so much that we forget that what is on the inside is what counts, and not on the outside. Oh and ecological” Arthur began to wind up, finally realizing that she really knows everything, and is asking only to check him.“Will you show me what you have inside? What lies underneath your packaging?” she suddenly asked.Arthur didn’t know what to say, so he only embarrassingly smiled.“Of course, I don’t want you to throw it away. Soon you’ll be able to hide under it again” she added and took him by the hand.Arthur completely forgot that he wanted to go to the bathroom. He allowed her to lead. They left the club. Grudziądz at night seemed to be mysterious and alluring. Arthur didn’t know what would come out of it. Where would this all lead him? Well. They were ecological, and their destiny was to become rubbish. Only faith remained that they wouldn’t be discarded anytime soon only out of material boredom. And even if it does happen, then at another time, someone else, somewhere else, again will want to use them."

			"body":"I’m lying in the sun. More like I’m melting. Very nice. If that is what a sausage on the grill feels, then sitting with a bare bottom on a grate wouldn’t be a great tragedy. Only what for this prison pattern? It’s like sunbathing through the bars of my own cell, and there’s not much more to say about it. I’m lying in the sun. I’m turning like a human shish kebab around my own axis. The sun travels with an arc around the sky. I’m turning like I’m impaled on an invisible stick. And together we are turning slowly. It’s as our complex machinery set the whole world in motion, and yet nothing happens. I’m not turning this world. It’s turning itself.Lying on my back, I tilt my head back. It looks as if the sea and the sky changed their places. But they didn’t change, otherwise the water, which by melting glaciers is increasing, would overflow the planet and we would probably be left with empty holes from the seas and oceans. And what would we do with those holes? The fish would die, even if all of humanity would begin giving mouth-to-mouth. Maybe we would get accustomed to it? These waters now aren’t clean anyways. What’s the difference - breathing dirty oxygen from the water or from the air?  I have no idea. Such a fish has little joy in life. At the most if bait somehow slips off the hook and the fish escapes with it in its mouth. As a result many a fishermen under their moustaches have let out insults. Well, we have two escapees. The fish and the insult. Both died in the depths of the waters. It’s all without sense. Well, getting back to my senses. Is every part of my divine body tanned?I take off my bikini. I start to look it over. A little bit out of boredom, but also because all the rotating has began to make me feel a little sick. A bikini is not a book - there is only the tag to read. So what?! 100% polyester! In other words - to call a spade a spade - non-renewable petroleum! Looking at the towel - the same thing! I’m covered in oil! Like those birds from the Gulf of Mexico. And not only me. Everyone at their own request is immersed in crude oil. Daily we are drowning in it from our socks to our buttons. It’s enough to state that from this the testosterone level drops and as if those on towels next to me got colder. After all, its “cotton - cotton - cotton”. More! Organic cotton, meaning the cotton among cottons. That which has never seen pesticides and fertilisers on its fibres. What’s more, it’s from Fair Trade, meaning nobody in China or Bangladesh was hurt by it. I want to see organic cotton on the labels! I want to be clothed in that! Polyester doesn’t really appeal to the eyes. It’s a bit annoying in the degradation stage, if it’s not taken for recycling. Maybe better viscose? Supposedly artificial, but has properties similar to cotton. Supposedly chemically produced, but from renewable raw materials. I don’t know. Instead of reading a label, I’d rather read a colourful magazine, even about fishing. Supposedly there was a time when it was forbidden to throw magazines in containers for recycled waste paper. At least that is what I heard, that a magazine is not a newspaper. And what is it supposedly? It does not matter, especially since recently they relaxed a bit. That’s good! Because soon this segregation despair will cause a person to get into a container himself and lay down in it. But which one? Hmm. My divine body is tanned all over. Fortunately, man is fully biodegradable, unless a person enlarges something. I confess immodestly - don’t need to. But first things first. I should start by emptying my pockets: Phone? Electro rubbish, so to the junk truck. Poop bag? For the dog of course! - plastic.Unpaid credit card? As above.Non-virtual money? Banknotes are waste paper, but not coins. After all, coins are metal.Breath mints? I would have eaten them, so they don’t count on the list. And then I’d have to undress. Remove the trouser’s zipper with my teeth, because - just like coins - it’s metal. I don’t know. Maybe it’s better to cut it into cloths?  On TV a lady shows such how to polish furniture with socks, but why does she put them on her hands when she just needs to bend her legs enough? But if the clothes are not destroyed? They can be given away. I can be buried, but someone else will wear it.The longer I think about it, the more logical segregation seems to me. As simple as the sun that surrounds my divinely tanned body. Because fortunately I have nothing on me. Completely nothing. Aside from the citation I’m holding in my hand for indecent exposure in a public place. Waste paper? "

			"body":"The clock struck twelve. The kindergarten teachers took their crossed-eyed kids with missing teeth and Paula continued to sit on the Poznan market. Apathetically chewing a piece of Margherita pizza she observed the crowd moving down the crooked cobblestones. She was not in a hurry to get back to the suffocating office and computer. She could not fathom what was in these people, that in such a heat they would want to try on, browse, compare and buy. After all, all those bags with known brands, which the tourists paraded around with in the city was evidence of such.She had no such desire. Stand in the queues and inhale fumes from the air conditioning? Oh, anything but that. Paula was an open and modern person. At least that is what she liked to think about herself, spending evenings shopping over the Internet. It’s no big deal that another pair of trousers was not needed. Miss such an opportunity? It would be a sin committed against one’s own appearance! Oh, that cream - fifty per cent cheaper than in the stop, and twice the size. At least when you look at the packaging, but again, people can’t be trusted. In the past a package brought by the courier, although the box was the size of a washing machine, contained only a microscopic jar. And even that was only filled half way. Paula did not even suspected that by paying for that little bit of cream, she was really paying for the packaging. She put the blame on fraudulent corporations and did not think about it anymore.Anyway, it was like that yesterday. After returning from work the long expected package with the new phone was waiting for her. Beautiful, pink and thin as a bookmark. However, before Paula got to it, she fought a lopsided battle for half an hour with the cardboard and tape. She won, but the stacks of blister packs were still piled up around the bed.Now, eating pizza and drinking water from a bottle, she recalled yet other such treasures filling up her kitchen, bathroom and all other areas of her studio. Stacks of read newspaper, hectares of empty water bottles, kilometres of ribbons for gifts and oceans of empty boxes. Yes, that was all there and what’s more very much caught the eyes. Nevertheless, tomorrow - tomorrow! - Sam is coming to her tomorrow. The same Sam who for months made sheep eyes to her and chatted at the coffee machine. The guy for whom she was prepared to invent a story about a broken computer to get him to come over. Ok, she’ll look very pretty in this mess - the true queen of the landfill, and that will be that!Once Paula had the idea that maybe it would be worth using the empty packaging somehow in a creative way. Plants flowers in yogurt containers or something like that. And maybe not take so many disposable plastic bags from the shop when only buying a newspaper. Or buy larger packaging, so not to collect so many bottles. Unfortunately, for the earth and its inhabitants, this thought disappeared as quickly as it appeared.Still looking at the pilgrimage of shoppers on the Poznan square Paula decided: “I’ll tell Sam I broke my leg. Maybe not. It will be difficult to hustle up a cast in so short a time. Perhaps I have such a severe stomach flu that the entire neighbourhood is under quarantine? Or there’s no need to fix the computer because thieves stole it?”.Each one of those thoughts emerging in her mind was more absurd than the previous. But the most absurd idea was the thought that she would single-handedly clean up that mess herself, and by tomorrow. Supposedly how was she supposed to do it? Change a moment into Superman?Despite the stultifying heat, Paula realized that the task of carrying tonnes of empty packaging is Mission Impossible multiplied by Waterloo. The effects of all those evenings spent before the computer screen will not defeat one small woman with two little hands, including one left hand. No, a final solution will be needed here.Moving is not an option. The flat is on credit and with a struggle to pay off. Arson? She might even get compensation, but the risk is too high. Maybe she could apply to a TV program? Or find a miracle worker?Suddenly, a brilliant thought came to Paula’s head: ask Christopher for help. Christopher was her friend from the other side of the desk: a shy introvert who always, when it seemed that Paula didn’t see it, threw her admiring glances from behind his monitor. In addition, he was a vegetarian and some other environmentalist - in fact, the mission of saving the planet was close to his heart. Maybe this and the mission of saving Paula will inspire him to help?Yes, Christopher will know how to get rid of all this junk. To which container to throw plastic, to which paper and what to do with this miserable foil. In addition, he is tall, so it will be easy for him to carry everything from the fourth floor. I’ll tell the poor chap that I collected all this to alleviate mother Earth and force him to silence by a promised dinner or going to the cinema. Only Sam can’t find out.Refreshed with this idea Paula stood up from the table and started walking. Pushing through the crowd of tourists, she didn’t notice the big, thin guy who for a good half hour observed her from the market arcade. He was just about to follow her when suddenly something vibrated in his shirt pocket.“Hi, this is Christopher. Sure, we can meet in the evening. And you know what? It is no longer valid about that girl from work. We won’t get along. You know, just a moment ago she threw a water bottle into a normal rubbish bin? I’m such a fool. All the time I thought that since a chick pays so much attention to her appearance that she’ll take care of more than just the tip of her nose.”"

			"body":"“This is old” my daughter Susie said, shaking her head. “It is” I nodded, “It is old. Her name is Lola.” “Why do I need this old rag?” she asked, adding “You promised me new Pet Shops.” “I thought that I already bought for you all of them that there are?” I replied, in accordance with the truth. I really thought so. For the cavalry of coloured, plastic ponies laying around in her room one could go on a nice vacation. “All the time new ones are coming out” she asserted, unmoved. Once again I showed her the doll, if it was the most valuable discovery in the world. The fact was that it was old and ugly as sin. But it belonged to her grandmother, and in contrast to the regiment of Pet Shops set on the cabinet, it had already been in this world for a few decades. “It’s washed. The clothes are washed too. It’s almost as good as new” I said. “I don’t need it” she replied, with the specific type of determination, which only a six year old could generate. “Do you need all these things?” I asked, waving my hand around her room and the pile of strewn around toys, dolls, teddy bears, blocks and action figures, which of course had to be more than all her friends as well as books and plastic buckets. Everyone buys their kids tonnes of toys. It’s normal. But it did not change the fact that Peter and I overdid it. “Yes” she said and sat down on the floor, with a look on her face, like a true general who is about to defend his army to the last drop of blood. Now I realized that the conversation awaiting me is not going to be easy. I sat on the floor in front of her. I laid Lola next to me. I pulled out this eyesore after ten years of lying in the attic in the very middle of a strong debate. I felt stupid. “Susie” I said to her, letting out a deep breath. It was hard for me, I had a dry throat. “Yes” my daughter responded, confirming that she heard me, looking me deep in the eyes. “Susie” I asked, “how many of these things are you really using?” “All of them” she said, tightening her mouth. “All? Some of these things we bought you some four years ago. Do you really want to say that the toys for two year olds are still the hit of the season?” “Age does not matter” said my daughter. I looked at the pile of toys in a plastic basket from Ikea in the corner of the room. There were quite a few of such baskets in my daughter’s room, and all of them were full to the brim. I went to it and began to rummage through it. My daughter very carefully watched my every move; not taking her eyes off me. One after another I took out monkeys, dolls, toy instruments, books for reading as well as various creatures of unknown species and colours. I stopped at the soft material crocodile, filled with foam, with a fairly stupid, though pretentious look. “What’s his name?” I asked Susie, waving the docile reptile before her eyes. “Lester” she declared, after a moment of hesitation. I knew it was a lie. “Lester” I nodded, “that’s strange. From what I remember, he was called Bob.” “Well, maybe he is Bob” she replied, visibly nervous now. “Susie” again I sat in front of her. “I found Bob a week ago squeezed under our bed. Judging by the amount of dust that covered him, he was lying there for a month.”“He got lost” stated Susie, explaining the situation very quickly. I nodded. Without standing, I threw Lester in the plastic container across the room. “Susie, I brought this doll not to tell you to play with it right now” I said, again lifting up Lola. “I understand that she is not really for showing off.”Lola really was not for showing off. Her plastic eyes were obviously cross-eyed. The wavy, gold hair looked more like the lush head of hair of an Italian tenor than a small child. The dress pattern was dangerously similar to a tablecloth in a roadside diner and the mouth formed a grimace that should resemble a smile, but in reality brought to mind a toothache. “It looks terrible” said Susie. “Well, you’re right, a little bit” I nodded. “But that’s not the point. The thing is that your grandmother had just a few dolls and teddy bears. And Lola was one of them.” “When grandmother was small, there was no money. You said yourself.” “Well, there was some, but Susie, it’s not about the money. The point is that toys need to be produced somewhere. In factories that pollute the environment. They consume gasoline. Then these toys are exported to countries where parents, like us, buy for kids, like you, tonnes of such toys. Most of these toys after half a year are totally unnecessary. Finally they land in the rubbish.” “You want to throw my toys away?” On the face of my daughter appeared a red alarm. The crying was coming - inevitable, unstoppable, like a rainstorm. “No, I don’t want to, God forbid” I replied. “I don’t want to throw them away.” But just think for a moment, do you really need to have so many Pet Shops, which in a moment you will not even play with. “But I will play with them for two months” my daughter declared. “That would be a record” I replied. I got up, leaving Lola on the carpet. I looked at Susie. She sat motionless, with clenched lips, but it did not seem like she was about to cry. She rather looked like someone who thought intensively. I was about to exit the room, leaving her with Lola, factories, Bob and all the bits and pieces. I knew that her clever, six year old mind will need a little time to deal with it. I was opening the door when she called to me: “Mum.” I turned around. “Mummy, how many of these factories are there?” she asked. “A lot. They are huge” I said. “As big as Warsaw?” she asked. “Yes, some are even bigger” I replied. “And they really pollute the environment? Those factories? They poison trees and water?” I nodded. Susie also nodded her head. We stood there for a moment, as if we were both trying to come to terms with the undeniable fact. Susie picked up Lola from the floor for a moment and then put her down again. “Forty-two” she said. “What do you mean forty-two?” as I wrinkled my eyebrows. My daughter sometimes could make me feel like in the film “The Shining”. “Forty-two Pet Shops,” she declared, looking at the cabinet. “That should be enough.” I smiled at her and she smiled back. Lola, lying on a carpet, had one eye on her and another on me, as if she wanted to make sure that we really worked things out. "
